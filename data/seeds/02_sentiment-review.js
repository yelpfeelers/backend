She didn't acknowledge us at all, until I shouted to her for assistance. The soda machine wasn't working & when she finally came out to turn it back on for us, the soda was completely flat. As far as the food, it needed to be AMAZING to make up for the terrible service. It wasn't. Don't give this place business & waste your money!

They have decent food but depending on what you order, some of the prices are kind of high for a small family owned restaurant. I'd stay away from the burritos or combos for that reason and only order from the tacos and breakfast sections of the menu. \n\nTheir al pastor tacos were pretty good but their super nachos were far from being super. It was mostly chips and not very many toppings. We took it home it threw our own toppings and salsa on it! \n\nAlthough they're food is decent, they do have some major issues that I noticed the first few times I stopped by:\n\n1. This is basically a take out only joint because they only have 1 table inside\n\n2. 50 cent fee to use a card no matter how much you order \n\n3. Received advertisement/coupons in the mail stating that breakfast was served from 5 am to 10 pm, however, when I stopped by one morning at 7:45 am they were closed. Apparently they don't open until 9 am every day!\n\n4. Only open 24 hours on Friday and Saturday despite having a 24 hour sign\n\nOverall based on the convenience factor of this location, and its proximity to several residential areas, I think they're going to give Roberto's a run for their money. However, keeping in mind that every previous restaurant in the same suite went out of business within a year, only time will tell..."

After 45 minutes I went in and asked to speak to a manager.

Dona Maria).  The cashier really seemed to know what she was doing in helping explaining any questions I had and checking to make sure that everything was in the bag.\n\nI will say that the flour tortillas for the tacos are really thin and pretty much disintegrated after the first bite so I had to use a fork to get everything else so that is a downer.

I mention \"belly\" because I am frequently reminded by my grandkids that I sport a big fat belly. \nOne of my days in Vegas I decided to look for a hole in the wall Mexican eatery. I turned to my favorite app Yelp for help (rather catchy phrase, isn't it ?)\nI settled on Bomb Tacos. Reading the reviews I could surmise that reviewers seemed to write with a certain passion for the food served here. \nLocated just three or four blocks from my downtown hotel, I arrived at Bomb with high expectations. \nMon Dieu!!!! This place is indeed da bomb. \nA comprehensive list of tacos as well as other Mexican fare. \nI ordered a triple: three tacos with three different proteins. Without a doubt five stars for the food. There was ample protein with just the right amount of \"other stuff\". \nThe tacos looked small but I was quite satiated with the quantity of food served. \nI have deducted one star for the absence of climate control inside. With 100 plus degrees outside, it was quite uncomfortable (guess either no air conditioning or just saving on electricity)!\nAll in all, I highly recommend this place especially considering the bang you get for your buck. \n\nSent from my iPhone"

The manager came out and apologized for the missing taco and offered us some special sauce they made that was a habanero mango Chile it was super spicy but sooo good!! \nThe manager then brought us out our missing taco plus a extra and still was apologizing but it really wasn't a big deal. \nWe really liked the place and the staff!

I walk in and greet the kid with dreads and a backwards hat Saturday morning and get no response.  He stands there like a statue till I order, then says nothing after I pay and tip.  He walks over to give me my food to go and hands it to me with no words....no thank you, no seeya next time, nothing.  I'm looking around for a film crew, thinking it's a prank show.  To the owner: you are insane to have this guy be the 'face' of your business.  Not a classy operation at all....maybe you just can't teach common courtesy but if it's my place, I'm not using someone with zero customer skills on the register.\n\nThe fact they botched my order and gave me no fish taco even though I asked for one and the receipt said so, didn't help either, but mistakes are made and usually forgivable. I paid $8.12 for two street tacos....one was the brisket I ordered and the other, who knows?  Can't complain about the taste of the tacos, but everything else was pathetic.\n\nI like to order small the first time, then if the restaurant is good, come back for a larger one.  I won't be coming back to Bomb Tacos....the bomb was a dud.  Plenty of other taco options around with workers who smile, use words, and act like they enjoy their job."

This place is definitely super creative.  \n\nSuper creative tends to go super expensive and you'll notice that here but I think it's worth a try.  The menu is large and I honestly felt slightly overwhelmed but I decided to go with the 3 fish taco plate with rice and beans.  \n\nThe fish tacos were great.  I wasn't even that hungry and irritated at myself for ordering so much food but yep, I ate it all.  The fish was seasoned well and fried perfectly crispy.  The cabbage, pico and guacamole on top were fresh and delicious.  The rice and beans were really good too.  I like that the rice is tangy.\n\nMy friend got the carne asada 3 taco plate and while I didn't eat one of his tacos, I forked some of the meat and it was REALLY good.  \n\nThe salsas at the condiment bar are also really really good.  You can tell they make them in house.  The only thing I didn't like was the carrot/jalapeno pickles.  They were very very mushy.  Really overcooked.  \n\nThe wait time from ordering to getting our tacos was a bit long (and we were the only people who had ordered) and it was really hot inside but the space is cute and you can people watch from the windows with your Victoria while you wait."

I was originally going to order tacos, but then I noticed the chilaquiles on the menu for $6.99 and I hadn't had breakfast. Ordered the Chilaquiles with al pastor meat and an horchata. They were good tasted different than chilaquiles I've had before the were \"fast food\", they were more like nachos with toppings than chilaquiles, but still good. The horchata was pretty sweet.

Their carne asada tacos (served three to an order) are alright and certainly come street-style as advertised, but aren't worth the $12.50 you pay to get three small tacos, a kid's meal-sized handful of chips, and a plastic cup of fountain soda. \n\nIf you're in Vegas and your heart aches for street-style Mexican food, venture a few miles off The Strip and enjoy cheaper, more authentic bites from one of the many mom-and-pop taquerias and taco trucks dotting our fair Valley. If leaving The Strip is absolutely non-negotiable, go big like a true Sin City tourist and splurge on Border Grill. It won't be any more authentic, but you'll feel less underwhelmed."

But I've been coming down to this area for years to find places just like this! Yes, it's straight out of South L.A. with all the questionable characters walking around. Be aware of your surroundings, and mind your own business, and enjoy some damn good tacos! The place occupies a old Wendy's and you have three lines to which to decide to get in. There's a line for Asada and Chorizo tacos, one for pastor and variations of it, and another for beef tongue and tripa. Pick one and get in line and the lines are long! It's worth it, and when you get up there you can always ask for something from the other line. The flour and corn tortillas are hand made and pressed before your eyes! The Asada was flame grilled before your eyes and lathered with a guacamole spread and salsa! Knock you out with the first bite! The spicy pork was equally as impressive, and this all left me thinking. Why aren't our good neighbors from the south of us just mass producing such great goodness as this!! This southern gentleman left thinking when you find a taco joint like this, and there's not many, appreciate it and find your way back again!!"

All made to order with fresh ingredient, including the soft taco where they stamp them as needed. Don't forget to try the different meat such as the beef tongue, they looked good.

The wait was over an hour, and we had to make friends with people that were already eating to secure a table for when we got our food. BUT it was well worth it! \n\nHere's what we got:\nCarne Asada tacos-average. I think they only had it on the menu to offer something familiar to the people that usually go to robertos\nLengua (tongue) tacos-very tender and beefy flavor\nTripa (intestine) tacos-fried and crunchy, a little greasy, tasted like pork rinds. Good, but are probably better after a night of drinking\nAdobada (marinated pork) tacos- delicious. The green sauce on it made it so much better\nAdobada quesadillas- same as the tacos but with melted cheese. Good, but I could have done without\nSuadero (beef) tacos- by far my favorite. Whatever they marinade/season/cook it in is amazing\n\nThere are 3 lines and each one only makes specific items. One strictly for adobada and the other 2 have a mixture. You order/pick up your food at the window cafeteria style and take it to the left to pay and get drinks. The employees hustle. They definitely have a rhythm about what they do. We spent quite a bit, but as you can tell,'we tried a lot. If you go in knowing what you want, it's pretty reasonable. \n\nWhile in line, we talked to a few people that were out of towners. Surprising to see how many there were since this place is nowhere near the strip. The new location is even further.\n\nOverall, great experience and will definitely be back time and time again"

Well I was on vacation and as much as I eat mexican food(almost every day) i do taco's maybe once a week. These taco's stood out in so many areas of how a taco should be put together. From the all star meat to the toppings. They don't leave you hanging here. \nThe first day I stood in the longest line in the place not knowing I was in the al pastor line with different meats having different stations until 5 minutes had passed. Too late I was committed and how could all those people be wrong? 2 taco's and a tostada later I'd happily stand in a line 5 times that long. \nNext day, I went back. Normally I love adventuring and trying out new places and new foods when traveling, but I hadn't gave the carne asada a shot yet. Got 2 taco's and carne asada fries. The taco's were again a big hit. If you're like me and feel desire to check a place with great ratings, there's a reason for this one."

The man was amazingly quick.  Made the tortillas warm, carved off some meat, scooped some onions, salsa and a guacamole crema. My sister was in line for the lengua. This server was just as quick and efficient. After getting our tacos, paid and got seated at one of the few empty seats. Started with the lengua. The lengua was not tough at all. Melt in your mouth amazing. The tortillas were full of flavor and the salsa was a perfect match.  Then went on to the al pastor. The flavor of the meat was great. The meat was tender and the sauces made it even better. The tortillas was dunked in the juices from the al pastor. Had this meal at 12:30am and I was already full but it was so worth it. I heard that the one near the Wynn always had a line for the lengua and the shorter lines were for the other meats. The location is a bit far off since it is in downtown but it is worth the drive.

So delicious and so addicting you would think that Walter White was actually doing all the cooking for you.\n Service is great friendly and efficient, the place is also very clean there's always an employee going around picking up trays and cleaning tables since this place is always packed with taco junkies. Every time I feel the urge to move to Colorado I stop at tacos El Gordo to remind myself of a reason to stay in Vegas. I swear nothing could beat a rolled taco with cilantro at tacos El Gordo. I only wish they were open 24 hours since is usually at the very late hours of the night when I start getting all those taco withdrawals after consuming a few spirited beverages.\nThey open late till 2am on weekdays and till 4 am weekends so make sure you leave the party or the club before that time so you can ingest some alcohol absorber. sometimes I get there late ( yes, I'm the one who knocks ) and end up looking for Roberto for an inferior fix.\nI have tried other places and this are the tastiest and best street style tacos in town by far for the price. \nTake a break from that treadmill, throw those diet pills away and get yourself some antacids instead and drive to tacos El Gordo right now for some instant satisfaction.\nWhy?\n .....Because I say so!"

I have no idea what kind of ingredients they put in this sauce, but I hope it's illegal because something that tastes this good is pure addiction.\n\n2) SPICY PORK! Meat so huge its as though if you stuffed your face and tore meat from the bone with your own teeth. There was so much in this taco, they did not skimp out at all like some other places. It also had so much flavor, I am salivating just thinking about it. \n\n3) CILANTRO! SHUT THE FRONT DOOR! I am a huge cilantro lover and the herbiness with the cream sauce, pork meat, and corn tortilla was NOM NOM NOM! I can seriously ask for a ton more because cilantro is so amazing.\n\n4) The adobada really isn't spicy according to my standards as I have a gazillion spice level tolerance. But, I poured a whole container of the green sauce they have to the side table, and it gave my tacos that extra kick with the cream sauce.\n\n5) LITTLE MEXICAN LADY! How AWESOME & NICE can she be?!?!

It's a taco circus with the cast of loco characters whipping out the finest tacos in the land. Very reminiscent of tacos I have had from many a street cart in the old country. So sit your culo gordo down and behold anything from spicy pork, to brains, to tongue, to beef and everything else. My faves so far are the choritzo and the spicy pork. A couple of yelpers have poo pooed the chorizo, I likey. At 2 bucks a pop, this qualifies as some exceptional cheap eats. \nBonus for the gratis grilled jalape\u00f1o peppers and green onion, the fresh radish and lime station, and the free drink refills."

Der Maisfladen war immer vollgesogen mit Fett und Sud, den man wie einen Schwamm ausdr\u00fccken konnte.\nBeim Bestellen sollte man wissen, in welche Schlange man sich stellt. Links gibt's Gegrilltes wie Steak, Chorizo etc. Mitte Gekochtes. Rechts W\u00fcrziges Schweinefleisch vom Spie\u00df. Abh\u00e4ngig davon was man bestellt, gibt es als So\u00dfe entweder Guacamole, Salsa oder gr\u00fcne Salsa. Als Beilage gibt es immer Zwiebeln, Tomaten und Koriander.\nBeim ersten Besuch sollte die Wartezeit 2 Stunden betragen. Da die Schlange quer durch den Laden f\u00fchrte, entschied ich mich am n\u00e4chsten Tag wiederzukommen. Musste ja genial sein, dass die Leute bereit sind so lange zu warten. Obwohl der Laden um 9 \u00f6ffnete, musste ich \u00fcber 30 Minuten warten bis ich das Taco mit Steak bekam. Die Chorizos waren nach 10 Uhr nicht mal fertig. Es war rein gar nichts fertig!!! Also ging es erst an die mittlere Bestelltheke. Die dort servierten Tacos schmeckten nach nichts. Alles zerkocht und ungew\u00fcrzt. Auf den Spie\u00df rechts hatte ich am Ende keine Lust mehr, weil ich meinen Vormittag nicht damit verbringen wollte auf Tacos zu warten, die nicht mal wirklich nach was schmeckten. \nDas Bestellsystem ist mehr als optimierungsbed\u00fcrftig, da das, was ich sehen durfte sowas von ineffektiv war, ja fast idiotisch. Jeder Koch nimmt gleichzeitig die Bestellung auf und serviert. Wie soll man bei drei Bestelltheken mit unterschiedlicher Nachfrage gleichzeitig essen? Die einzige M\u00f6glichkeit gemeinsam und alles zu essen ist wenn Laden leer ist. Alles andere ist utopisch. Und dann mit dem vollen Tablett zur Kasse, die sich dann auch beim Eingang befindet. So stolpert der bezahlende den reinkommenden \u00fcber die F\u00fc\u00dfe und tritt den wartenden auf die Zehen. Was ein Chaos! \nNein Danke! Ein Mal und nie wieder!!"

The tongue was prepared to the almost-perfect texture, and as my dining companion has described it, the tongue \"was clean\" - pure tongue meat. \n\nAnd, of course, the adobada tacos were also very delicious.  The grilled pineapple highlights the flavors of the meat and becomes a pleasant surprise in the mouth.  \n\nWe also had the carne asada, which I thought was quite tasty; however, it was not spectacular.  \n\nOne thing about Tacos El Gordo is that it is a bit pricey compared to its competition.  At $2.50 a pop for the lengua taco, it is definitely on the high-end side.  \n\nThen again, you get what you pay for!  Me gustan tacos!"

Perhaps good reason for it; the provenance makes Guadalaraja, Mexico the place of origin (having done business there for enough years we genuinely believe the history), and even in other parts of Mexico it is not easy to find. But we are starting to see the sandwich show up on some Las Vegas menus, and we have to give a shout-out to El Birotazo for making the best that we have found so far.\n\nTorta Ahogada literally means \"drowned sandwich\". Roast pork in a salty bollilo (the latter preferrably just a bit stale), dipped into a spicy chile arbol-based sauce. Add some pickled onions and a squeeze of lime. A fantastic combination if the meat is roasted properly and the bread sturdy enough to have a little staying power (especially if eaten from a cart in Guadalaraja).\n\nEl Birotazo does it right. The owners are from Guadalajara and take a lot of pride in their product. Generous with the meat, and the bread is crusty and has just enough oomph to get about two-thirds of the way through before it collapses. But no problem - they serve it in a shallow plate with a spoon, so that you can enjoy to the last drop. As for the rest of the small menu, we do not have a clue - all trips have been for this sandwich, and it is difficult to think about taking any other direction."

I was getting annoyed because at first nobody acknowledged me until an employee sitting in the front eating told the guy at the register that he needed to help me, I finally order, it took a minute but fine I was really craving this and someone told me it was really good. I finally get my horchata & torta ahogada to go & to my surprise everything was perfectly packed & secure, it smelled delicious. I get home & it was absolutely wonderful. Everything tasted great the tomato sauce was full of flavor, the spicy sauce w/onions was so good & super spicy, on a scale from 1 to 10 it was a 20! Yes so if you don't do spicy that's not for you. The horchata was really good too, homemade. The credit card machine does charge a dollar so if you want to save that take cash. I'll definitely be back but I will call in my order in advance."

Their whole website is in Spanish and I couldn't figure out what to get\n\nThat being said, I finally made it with the help of my coworker who said she'll order for me.  Supposedly they're known for their Tortas Ahogadas.  \n\nWe get there and the place is PACKED! We were able to snag the last table and wait for someone to help us.  They said you can ask what spiciness you want (I think the only options is spicy or no spice.) I got one of each.  The tortas came out to be $8 a piece.  We ordered them to-go, and what we got were 3 sandwiches and 2 bags of sauce.  \n\nI assemble them at home and I decided to serve the sauce on the side instead of laddling it on top because man was the spicy sauce SPICY!!  I tried one of the onion slices that was a part of the sauce and my mouth was burning, my eyes were tearing up, and my ears were ringing!  I have never felt that type of spiciness before.  It was so spicy, yet so addicting because I couldn't stop myself from trying it again and seeing how much I could take.  \n\nThe non-spicy sauce was also good. and that's what I used for most of my torta.  I smelled a lot of oregano.  The torta itself looks plain, its just some bread and meat. But that meat was well worth it!  It tasted like lechon shredded up and put into a sandwich.  There were no fillers, just a good chunk of meat.  (If you're looking for lechon without buying the pig, this is the place to go!)"

I dined at a trendy modern Latin/fusion restaurant miles from here and they served something they passed off as barbacoa (tasted like mop strands soaked in mild chili sauce). Barbacoa should be done with beef cheeks and/or the meat from the head braised then flash grilled to add some crispy bits. Today I set out to find decent barbacoa.\n\nBiriatazo specializes in Tortas in Guadalajara style.  But I came for barbacoa. Their barbacoa seems to be done with brisket and then shredded into strands. The barbacoa tacos are distinctive and satisfying with wonderful seasoning and fresh crisp condiments.  My only reservation is the barbacoa is a tad too lean for my preference.  I like a barbacoa that hits you with the power of well marbled short rib.\n\nAs far as ambiance there is none, people are here to eat good food period. The place is small and they fill up quickly, so even take out involves a little wait."

I have a slight addiction to it.\n\nMy buddy and I were supposed to hit this up after snowboarding one day, but it was close by the time we got there (Close at 7pm).  The interest got the best of me so i made a trek on my own to check it out the next day after he told me about their Torta Ahogada: A Mexican sandwich over a bed of tomato sauce.  This was an OK dish as i find nothing to rave about.  The tomato sauce was nothing special and meat appears to be Carnitas inside the hard french roll.  For 6.50 I thought the portion was quite small.\n\nSince i made it this far i wanted to make sure i got the most out of this place, so I asked the server for his recommendation.  His response, the Barbacoa tacos.  I thought this was exceptionally good esp for $1.75 a pop. The beef was tender and have more flavor in comparison to Cafe Rio's.  A squeeze of lime, onions, cilantro, and esp that red hot sauce will put it on another level though.  I had to order seconds just because I love that hot sauce.  Not sure if it was taboo, but i was also picking out the slice onions from the hot sauce and eating them. That made me ;]~ \nI left happy and my mouth still had a nice burning sensation while i was driving down the freeway.  \n\nI want their hot sauce recipe, nao!"

                  "text": "Wow. wow. wow. \n\nHad lunch today with two friends at El Birotazo and tried enough dishes to be able to write a credible review of their exceptional food.\n\nTorta Ahogado: made with pork, this is a Mexican-dip as opposed to a French dip - and it's incredibly delicious.  They make their own bread, too, which makes this crusty bolillo surprisingly resilient - but since they bring out an additional bowl of tomato-arbol sauce, there's no reason to panic... We split this three ways and I have to say, I thought about forking my friend for her share, but I behaved myself...\n\nTacos de Canasta:  I did a little research before we left for the restaurant so I'd not miss out on something I'd never had before merely because I was a newb... when I read that these are steamed tacos (also called Tacos Vapor) - so that the corn tortillas are soft and pliable filled with, for one option, potato, I knew we'd have to order some.  We also tried a chicken version, but it wasn't nearly as delicious as the potato.  This is a simple dish - but a perfect foil for their amazingly spicy, onion arbol broth and their smokey salsa loaded with cilantro.\n\nTacos Dorados:  we ordered two beef  tacos.  These are the lovely crispy tacos - not rolled like flautas, but normal shape, filled with beans and cheese, fried crispy, then topped with the meat of your choice.  Great flavor, great texture - these were not greasy or heayy at all.  Fabulously messy finger food.  I'd have killed for a cold beer.  \n\nWhen we realized we still had room to try one more thing, we followed the lead of a little girl at a neighboring table, busily working through a barbacoa taco - so we ordered three so we wouldn't have to share this time  -- and it was the right decision.  The barbacoa tacos are double tortilla'd - one plain, the other dipped in the same tomato-arbol broth - filled with deliciously tender and juicy pulled beef - deshebrada - loaded with cilantro and light onion.  If you eat these with a fork to avoid the juice dripping down your arm, you're missing the point.  One hand-held bite of these and everything you think you know about tacos vanishes. \n\nI really can't decide which I like better of the torta and the barbacoa, but I know I'll be back - and with more willing tasters, because they have things like Lonches Calientes, that I still haven't had, and other torta flavors- goat and lamb and pork skin plus tostadas of all sorts...prepared traditionally like they do in Guadalajara with a crispy tortilla on the bottom and one on top - \n\nYes - the menu is in Spanish, their website, too - the service, if you're prepared and have taken a look at their visual menu on their website: http://elbirotazo.com/menu/, is friendly, encouraging and helpful.  Please be the same in return.\n\nAt lunch, it was packed - we got there early (before 12) and didn't wait for a table, but it was a Monday, and my guess is this place fills up quickly for their authentic, delicious, simple food.   Lots of families with their small children - which confirmed one thing we all agreed - this wasn't super spicy (unless you loaded up on the onion sauce they bring to the table...which is addictive), it's very kid-friendly and approachable which is nice to know - and great for introducing kids to real Mexican food...which I think is very important.  \n\nFood comes out quickly. (Another plus, if you're dining with children - or a hangry adult - so hungry, they're angry...)  \n\nCredit cards accepted. And if you go with more than 4 folks, it may take a while, most of their tables are 4 tops, and it's not a big place.  \n\nTo get there, take Charleston east to Lamb, make a uturn at the light and it's on your right a block back.  \n\nThis was definitely worth hunting for..."

Since I got it to go, they put the sauce and the onions in a little baggy for me.  So, I got home, drenched it and ate.  Had to finish with a fork, but the bread stood up well to the sauce, which is liquidy.  The onion/salsa mixture is HOT, but great.  Basically, it was Mexican pulled pork with the sauce and onions.

It fit all the description-- small, hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant.. one of my favorites! \n\nOnce I went to the restaurant, I was excited to try everything to see if it was as authentic as it seems outside. However, I was greeted with a rude server who just looked at me as if I was confused. He told me and my party to sit anywhere and so I tried looking for a place where it was clean and not crowded. Once I was ready to order, I asked the server how big the tacos were and he said \"What do you mean how big the tacos are?\" as if I was stupid.. I mean there are small tacos where I need to order at least 4 to fill me up or the slightly larger ones that I don't need to order as much. I had to use my hands to explain to him what I meant. When I finished ordering, I just realized that they were closing in 5 minutes and maybe that's why he was so rude. Once I realized that, I decided to just take my food to go thinking that it would be easier for everyone at the restaurant. The server was saying it was okay-- but i'm sure he was just saying that. I hate being the last customer eating.. I already felt like I was unwanted in the restaurant, so I wanted to leave as soon as possible.\n\nThe food came out really fast and everything was packed in a plastic bag.. including the sauces and literally... EVERYTHING! When I got home, it was more like... build your own taco, tostado and an ahogada. \n\nTacos en Barbacoa- It was amazing! I really really liked the taco and the meat.. (oh, it is the larger tacos, btw. twice the size of the small ones) I ordered two which filled me up! I guess I liked it because I didn't really have to build my own taco. It they just put the sauce on the side and the condiments so I just placed it inside.. probably the ONLY thing that I liked.\n\nTostado en Carne- I had to make it myself... would probably have been better if I was there, but it wasn't as good.. the portion was huge! I definitely like the one from Tacos El Gordo better. They have smaller portions which makes it easier to eat and melted cheese... yum!\n\nTortas Ahogadas- did not look as good as the picture. I just didn't like it, period. I don't see what the hype was about. \n\nOverall, I give this place a 3 STARS. If it wasn't for the delicious tacos, I would have given this place 2 STARS. Service can definitely be better. I felt so unwelcomed and if they didn't want to serve us, they should have told us that the place was closing in 5 minutes instead of looking at us as if we were lost and confused."

I am glad she did.\n\nThe parking lot sucks to get to and is jam packed.\n\nThere are separate lines here depending on which meat you want to eat.  Look for the signs at the front of the line.  When we came in the whole inside of this place was packed.  It was very confusing for me in the beginning, but K.O. helped me navigate through the madness.\n\nWe stood in the Adobado line and got us 2 tacos and 1 mula to share.  Remember to ask for hot sauce when you get your food.\n\nAdobado Taco - the meat was cooked well and on a spit. When you see meat on a spit you know its going to be cooked well, charred slightly on the outside and moist in the inside.  All the trimmings were delicious and that green sauce was really creamy and helped elevate the flavors.\n\nAdobado Mula - First time trying it and its basically 2 tortillas with meat, cheese, and other things inside.  This was delicious and wish I had found out about this sooner.\n\nAfter you get your food, you have to find the cashier line and pay. When we were here the horchata tasted really watered down and not good. The orange bang on the other hand was delicious.\n\nSeating may be hard to find, but we found one outside fairly easily.\n\nThe place could be a little cleaner and less hectic.  The inside is crammed with ppl and hard to get refills on drinks.\n\nI would definitely come here again but maybe one of their other locations."

I sought out this place based on its glowing reviews so I had to try it. We got there around 3pm on a Sunday afternoon and there was a line but it moved pretty fast. I decided to try the Asada Taco, Abodada Taco and a small order of the Abodada fries. They were all packed with flavor. I was happy I made the trip. They have about maybe 15-20 tables and maybe 2 were available when we were ready to sit and chow down. They are busy and it makes sense why since they offer good tasting fast food for a great cost.

Typically we are warned that the lines are super long out the door. Upon arrival, lines were long, but not too bad.

Well you have to get in another line which is time consuming and unorganized. I wanted fries with my tacos but felt so rushed at the front, it just didnt seem like an option\n\nThe 3 tacos were absolutely delicious and fulfilling though and I got everything on them. (Sidenote: My friend and I stomachs but got messed up later/day after because of these tacos. Could just be a single experience but still-it was the only thing we really ate that day).

It was our first time. \nA bit confusing with different lines you have to stand in base on what you want. \nWe asked the cashier and she explained it well. \nYou can pay ahead of time or pay after you order and get your food. It's $2 a taco. \n\nWe got the beef tacos (Carne Asada)- It was okay. Maybe overly cooked, kind of chewy.  Not memorable.  3/5 stars.\n\nWe also tried the park tacos (Adobada)- mmm... taco heaven. Tender. They refer to it as spicy pork but it's not spicy. The taco tasted amazing. You can have pineapple on the side or on it. Same for the cilantro.  Throw some lime on it and boom ...5/5 stars! \n\nWe didn't try the other items. \nWe highly recommend the pork tacos. Went back again just for them on Sunday sept7 evening.  The second time we went, they were cooking the pork at both stations and had to wait 10mins. This was around 6:30pm. Both evenings the line up wasn't too long. \n\nNegative- Most of the cooks were wearing hats. One was wearing a hair net.  It can get pretty hot and they were working hard. Lots of sweat. With the cook sweating that much on his face, it was not appealing to fear lots of the sweat dropping on to the meat as he was chopping it up.

The carne asada was above average but in hindsight I wish I would have skipped it and gotten more Adobada tacos or sopes. If you don't know what a sope is, try one. It's basically a soft, fat corn tortilla. It's like a gordita (and no, not like a taco bell gordita; those don't remotely resemble a real gordita). \n\nIf you want to eat for under $25 for two, eat the best taco or sope you'll ever have, and impress your friends with some real local knowledge... Eat at Tacos El Gordo. And after you eat and hit the casinos/clubs and you're sloppy drunk, go back and eat more. That's what I did. If there were one of these where I live I'd eat there 365 days a year and that's no bullshit. It's that good people. I think the meat is roasted by a crack pipe. It's seriously addicting.  I would consider giving up sex and becoming a priest to eat it daily.  If I were on death row I'd ask for Tacos El Gordo for my last meal.  If aliens landed tomorrow I'd take them to Tacos El Gordo to show them human cuisine and I'm pretty sure I would save the planet from total annihilation because they'd know the human race is rad because we can cook the shit out of some pork. \n\nDon't be a dummy, just do as I say and eat there. You can thank me later."

We drove by it late Friday night and the line was about 100 people out the door, no joke. So we decided to go Sat around 4 hoping the line wouldn't be that bad. Well, there was a line, but not as long. From the moment we arrived to the moment we sat (if you're lucky to get a table) was 1 hr and 15 mins. Was it worth the wait, kind of. The tacos are traditional street tacos which is great, the price is right at about $2.75 a taco, but by the time you get your food, pay and eat, your food is cold. Tacos still tasted good, but if they were piping hot, that would of been better. HEADS UP, they have designated lines for specific tacos, so if you want different cuts of meat, you will have to have two people stand in different lines or get into both lines at different times. The layout and way they have the lines set up is what causes the wait to be so long. They do make the tacos fresh when you order, but they do get cold quickly. Was it worth trying, yes, but maybe once only."

The food was as good as the photos I kept seeing on my Instagram feed. \n\nIt's a different way to order your meal than I am used to, but it's pretty efficient. You line up according to which ever part of meat you want on your Taco or fries and order when it's your turn. They call your name if it's fries because it takes a few extra minutes longer to prepare the fries for the carne asada fries. I got the half portion with two tacos (one lengua and one al pastor) per person and it was still too much food for 2 people. With 3 people it was perfect. Their Horchata was good, too! \n\nThanks for the recommendation Mary-Ann!"

Let me summarize my experience:\n\nCheap prices = check\nDelicious food = check\nGood service = check\nOpen 24 / 7 = check\nAuthentic = check\nCleanliness = check\nStrip convenience without strip prices = check\n\nThis is not your average taco stand.  The staff all dons branded company T-shirts, the service is friendly, and it's not a hole-in-the-wall.  It also feels to commercialized to be authentic with it's stainless steel walls and fixed furniture.  Nonetheless, they've taken a simple concept and have executed it very well.  \n\nMy sister and I came here around midnight.  We ordered two taco's each and one quesadilla to share.  Each taco (steak and pork) was succulent and full of flavor.  The quesadilla was the best I've ever had (full of steak with some excellent cheese).  Every order also comes along with grilled green onions and grilled whole jalape\u00f1o's... which were delicious as well.  You also get your choice of green and red salsa and accompaniments such as limes and radishes.  The food was so good that I could have had probably had eight tacos to myself.  Unfortunately, my stomach told me I was full after two tacos and half a quesadilla.  The total price of our meal for two?  Under $13 including tax.  This is how you win in Vegas.\n\nI'll be back soon enough..."

However, during this last trip I was prepared, we made sure to go before we got super hungry, so by the time we got our food, it would be perfect timing. I love that they have different lines for different types of meats. While this saves time for some, it makes the wait longer for others. For example, the carne asada line was extremely long, while the adobada line was like 1/3 in length. For me personally I love all kinds of tacos, so it wasn't a deal break to go into the shorter line. I ordered a few tacos and a mula, which was super amazing. During my 2nd visit, the carne asada line was shorter, so that's where I went. I would say besides the long wait, the Tijuana style tacos are good,  will definitely be back."

I recommend the salsa verde, it's not the best in the world but it compliments the pork quite well. Only complaint about the tacos is the price. At $2.95 each it's hard to get full without spending a lot.\n\nThe quesadillas are good too. They use real cheese and dry cook them (no oil or, God so help me, butter) on the outside like you see at some places. Served with a side of chips, these are the best deal in my opinion at $4-8 each.\n\nBurritos were the least good. Not bad, just not amazing either and at $8-10 not a great deal either. The meats are the same as the other items, it's the rice and beans that lets this dish down. They're both bland. Stick the other items or find yourself a salt shaker and grab some salsa.\n\nI'll be back on my next trip to Vegas."

So when I found out they were making it a permanent fixture I was super excited!  Its located just inside the entrance the of the Four Queens Hotel and Casino.  Its perfect when you're sitting on the Patio Bar to run in and grab a quick bite.  The food is simple, unassuming and delicious! Plates of three tacos in either chicken, pork, or steak with salsa are all very tasty!  But the standout for me is the pulled pork nachos.  Its the classic tortilla chips and cheese, topped with shredded pork and barbecue sauce!  I added a side of fresh sliced jalapenos . So good!  Just enough to share with a couple of friends.  And don't worry, the price isn't going leave you broke.  This place just adds to the list of reasons why love staying Downtown and keeps Fremont Street getting better and better."

You have 3 options for tacos or a Combo plate with a taco from each. No sides, nothing. They stuff the taco's with a good amount of meat, and they're slightly bigger than your traditional street tacos which isn't a bad thing. Not too bad for a taco place on Fremont Street I guess."

They are located at the corner of the hotel that's outside facing the Fremont Strip. You can sit outside while you enjoy the weather or ppl watch as you eat.  Or you can eat inside where there is A/C if it's too hot during the summer.  There is also an outside bar outside next to the restaurant so you can also grab some drinks while you eat.  \n\nThe hotel will give you coupon booklets which has a coupon offer of buy 2 entree combo for the price of 1.  The combo is a 3 item taco combos which you can choose from carne asada, chicken or pork.  Usually it's $6.49 for a 3 time taco. Price is reasonable since you are at Vegas.  But even worth it when you have the coupon for buy one get one free.   They heat up the tortilla fresh and the meat is also fresh.  I also like the freshly home made green sauce.   Unfortunately they don't have guacamole.   But they do have free salsa, lime, onions, cilantro and cheese that comes as toppings.  I highly recommend the chicken tacos.   It was super yummy with the moist chicken.  \n\nMenu is simple and easy to order.  Aside from tacos which they are known for, they also serve nachos, hot dogs, quesadilla and cookies."

The tacos here are DIY, in that you purchase your protein by the pound, which comes with tortillas, then visit the veggie station and salsa bar to customize. They also have an aguas frescas bar with several house-made options!\n\nTheir grand opening promo consists of a pound of protein with tortillas, chips, tacos dorados (fried mini tacos in sauce), mini sopes, and enchiladas (sauced crisped tostadas), all for $20. It'll easily feed 3 and the assemble-it-yourself style lets you adjust the veggie/protein ratios to your preference. While the asada was not very well seasoned, I really liked the flavor of the al pastor recommended by the server. The enchiladas, sopes, and dorados were more authentic than I expected, in a good way. I also especially like how their salsa bar is stocked with a variety of colors, flavors, and spice levels, along with cups and lids to take some home.\n\nLocation is festively decorated with hats hanging on the walls, colorful seat cushions and cloth napkins, and Loteria card menus.  I did not see but hope that they add sides of rice and beans, and an options for shredded cheese and flour tortillas (currently just queso fresco and corn). This seems to be a good spot for groups, so I'll likely bring in some friends soon. They also offer churros for dessert!"

You can taste the freshness in every single bite. The owner informed us that everything is hand prepared fresh every day, nothing is ever frozen, and all recipes are top secret family recipes.

You basically choose your choice of meat and the rest is your choice.  They offer a salsa bar with 6 options of fresh made salsas and a veggie bar where you can choose exactly what you want to accompany your tacos.    Thirsty from that dry desert air?  Try one of the 6 options of aguas frescas that will quench any dry desert palate.  \n     What I love so much about Evelyn and Randy's fun concept is it gives the guest the option in every bite.   Oh, and let's not forget about the handmade tortillas!  Night and day difference from the non fresh variety and worth the price admission on their own.  Really outstanding.

You can tell the amount of thought put into the decor. To the hats on the walls, to the church pews made into benches, to the colorful linens and tables. Evelyn, the owner of the restaurant told us that a lot the pieces she used to decorate were found online or through garage sales. I love that this place is one of a kind! You will really appreciate the small touches and details that she made in this place.\n\nAs for the food, it definitely feels like the food is made with a lot love. She learned what she knew from cooking from her Grandmother. (you know that's special.) You can tell they really care about the quality of the food and the way that the food can be shared with your loved ones. The tacos are family style, you pick the type of meat you want. They provide all your fixings.. Salsa, veggies, homemade corn tortillas. What more can you ask for? You can also customize your tacos to however you want. I am pretty picky, so it's nice that I can have whatever I want with my tacos. Ha. The pollo was my favorite! It had just the right amount of seasoning. My husband liked the al pastor, he said it was very tasty. The carne asada was good as well. It was a nice asada flavor. I was super impressed with their homemade corn tortilla for some reason. It was perfect, they make it to order. They are warm when it comes to your table. So good! Any meat you decide, will be delicious.\n\nThe salsa bar was nice as well! They have 6 different types of salsa. I didn't get a picture of it, but the way you can tell the spice level of the salsa, is by the chilies! Mild has 2 chilies and hot has 3-4 chilies! You'll see what I mean when you come here ;) They have small containers with lids in case you want to take some home. \nThe veggie station was nice and clean. Everything was chilled on ice. There were onions, cilantro, lettuce, tomatoes, limes, cabbage, and radishes! They provide plates next to it so you can customize how much or how little you want of everything. \n\nThe agua fresca station is my other favorite. Their drinks are made fresh, they have a bunch of different flavors. I like mixing the limon with the hibiscus/jamaica. It is so refreshing! My husband got the strawberry fresca and that was a little more sweet, but not overly sweet. Since we are on the topic of about sweets.. you need to order the churro dessert. I prefer no sauce on the churros, but again.. the churro was made to order and fried right after you order. It came out crispy and soft on the inside. Their churro did remind of a disneyland churro. The sauces on top of the churro and ice cream, were a berry and chocolate sauce.\n\nLast but not least of what I loved about this place was that they try and do things eco friendly. From their to go boxes to the bags they give you, they are made from better materials and can be recycled. At least they are trying to show that they care about the environment with small things like that. I do appreciate that they don't give out straws unless someone asks for one. \n\nEvelyn and Randy were so sweet and patient with us. They answered all our questions about the menu and what everything means to them. I feel like this place is going to be very special and I am excited for what they can offer us in the future!!"

The seitan for the asada is flavorful, however, the texture is too spongy for my taste.  The al pastor seitan had the same type of spongy texture as the asada, but this one lacked  flavor. I wouldn't order it again. \n What I  was really pleased with  was the sope. The dough was not greasy, not undercooked, not too thick.  Also, the beans were on point, soft and had its own flavor. The sour cream didn't  really taste like anything and the shredded cheese looked more like mozzarella cheese  instead of queso fresco or cotija which is what it's  traditionally served with.\nThe horchata water was by far the only item you couldn't  that was vegan. It had that sweet and cinnamony taste that regular horchata has.\nI knocked down 3 stars due to the following:\n\nSo, I left this place thinking about giving it 3 stars, maybe 4, maybe. However,  around dinner time I called in to place an order for a pick up. I knew they closed at 8:00 PM and it was 7:40 already which is why I called it in. A man answered the phone and when I asked him if I could place an order for a carry out, he paused and said \" you wanna place an order right before we close?\" Mind you, they still had another 20 minutes to go. How rude. I told him I knew that and would be there within 10 minutes. He then proceeded to take my order.\n\nAlso, the establishment seemed cleaned but it was extremely hot in there and when I arrived the cashier lady was all by herself at the front. She was taking orders, taking them out, cleaning tables. She was really hustling. And she (cashier/bus lady/server) told me  that the A/C wasn't working  properly so maybe I just went on the wrong day. No big deal. Regardless, the place is missing decorations. The walls seemed to have been painted recently  with a burnt orange color. And that's all that was done to it. Also, the chairs and tables are extremely worn down. \n\nThis place has potential but lacks customer service, uniformity and the food needs improvement."

                  "text": "I can't believe that there is a Mexican restaurant that is completely vegan! And on top of that, it's actually really, really good!\n\nSo I actually had this place bookmarked a few weeks ago since its not that far from where I live. I had looked at a few of the pictures and saw the 4.5 star ranking and figured any place with this many good reviews I need to try. I saw they had Vegan tacos but I assumed they just had a few items, not the whole menu. I'm not vegan, but I have recently been trying some vegan food in an attempt to eat healthier. I found the fact that this place is completely plant based to be a pleasant surprise.\n\nSo my wife and I ordered too much food as usual (thank you for to-go boxes) and were very happy with almost everything. We got the nachos with \"asada\", five different types of tacos, potato taquitos and a Cuban torta.\n\nThe nacho cheese sauce was fantastic and you couldn't tell it wasn't real cheese. We asked how it was made and told us it is made with potatoes, carrots and nutritional yeast, plus some secret ingredients. I would eat this over the usual neon yellow nacho cheese any day.\n\nThe torta was my favorite thing, and again I couldn't tell it wasn't real meat. It had \"ham\" and \"turkey\" and \"hot dogs\", along with tofu, avocado and \"cheese\". Though I wouldn't call this a Cuban, it was easily the equal of any other torta I have ever had.\n\nThe taquitos were one of only two things that weren't that great (I'll get to the other later). It's not that they were bad, it's just that they weren't as good as the other food we had. They potato didn't really stand out as a filler for the taquitos, but they were pretty decent after being dipped in salsa. If you are a person that likes taquitos more for the crunch of the fried tortilla than the meat inside you'll probably like these. I could see myself ordering them again if I was in the right mood.\n\nFor the tacos we got one \"asada\", one \"pastor\", one \"chorizo\", one \"chicken\" and one mushroom. The mushroom (the only one not trying to imitate meat), while far from traditional was delicious. Along with the mushroom we also loved the chorizo, which you couldn't tell wasn't real chorizo. The chicken was also very good and tasted like chicken, and the pastor could pass for pork but was a little to sweet for my taste. The only one we didn't really care for that much was the \"asada\". We also ordered the asada on our nachos and it was by far the least favorite \"meat\" we tried. It wasn't so much that it was bad, but it didn't taste anything like carne asada or beef in general for that matter. Its consistency was more like a sausage than steak, and it's probably the only thing we wouldn't get again.\n\nThere was also one additional meat, cactus, which we didn't try but I guess we will get that next time. I can't really hold the \"asada\" against them considering I have yet to find a vegan substitute for beef that actually taste like beef. I have now had vegan cheese, eggs, pork and chicken and loved each one, but I guess beef is much harder to pull off.\n\nThe prices were on par with any other Mexican place you'd go to, though I thought the torta for $10 was a little high, despite how good it was. The nachos on the other hand for $5, with the option to add meat for a $1, are a fantastic deal.\n\nEven if your not vegan, but you enjoy Mexican food, I highly recommend coming here. If you are vegan then this place is a must."

Imagine how happy I was to see their food truck parked outside of the Natural Grocers store right in MY neighborhood! They said they were going to be there every weekend (except for First Fridays)!  I had the 3 street tacos, and I tried 1 of each flavor. OMG SO AMAZING!!!  The flavor is so authentic, you forget that it's 100% vegan! I became a vegan about 8 months ago, and I have had so much fun discovering all kinds of incredible, healthy food. Pancho's is hands down my favorite when it comes to Mexican food. I will be stopping by their food truck EVERY weekend!!!  Thanks so much for coming to my side of town!"

We also got the al pastor tacos and T H A T  M E A T  I S  T O  D I E  F O R. They put pineapple in it and it has to be one of the most perfect blends.

As I just recently started cutting meat/animal products out of my diet i figured I'd give Pancho's a try. I ordered an Asada burrito to go. Holy smokes!  The burritos are not only huge but tasty as well. I ended up having 1/2 for lunch and finished the other 1/2 for dinner. \nMy next visit I ordered the dorrados (potato tacos) with rice and beans. Everything was seasoned and full of flavor. Definitely a yummy choice.\nMy subsequent visits resulted in orders of Pastor nachos with nacho cheese instead of shredded, and asada street tacos. Everything I've ordered has been delicious and I definitely don't feel like I'm missing out on not having meat. \nSince the recent expansion and addition of a second register, ordering to go has been so easy. In fact maybe too easy as I've been to Pancho's 7? times in the last month and a half and today was recognized by the guy who normally runs the register.  I think I've become a regular...lol. It's conveniently located down the street from my workplace and so easy to pick up lunch when I've forgotten to bring mine from home."

They're so delicious and simple, Two just never seems like enough. \n\nTonight we ordered the 3 taco special that comes with a drink for 6.99. Those were great as always, my fav. \n\nWe also ordered the the classic nachos, oh my gosh were those huge! Way more than the two of us could eat and they were delicious too. I forgot to snap a picture of just how big and pretty they were. I liked them a lot though,  I wish the cheese could have been melted into the chips before adding all the rest of the toppings. For the cheese being vegan it is good but would be better melted. \n\nAs for Panchos itself, this place is always busy! They're actually expanding right now into the unit right next door. The set up is great. They take the orders in the old room and you sit and wait in the expansion room. The menu also looks larger than the last time I was there. They're offering burgers, no-so-tuna melts and even breakfasts. \n\nI've heard the tamales were good, I need to try those next time. They sell them by the dozen, just check ahead of time if they have any. \n\nThumbs up to Panchos!  Yummm!"

It's difficult to get younger children to maintain the plant based eating habits. You have an opportunity to truly craft a solution that is much needed in this town, and in my favorite type of food, Mexican. \n\nTaking this need and owning it could go a long way! It's also not advantageous as a parent to order the quesadilla and it be over $7. \n\nI wanted to just get that tidbit out of the way so I can reinforce that aside from the suggestion - this restaurant still receives top marks. \n\nThe enchiladas are amazing, sopes and posole - just the way I remember, as well as street tacos and other popular favorites! \n\nYou get red or green sauce, or when you takeout - both, and it's phenomenal. I took advantage of the $1 Vegan donuts and yea, just had to. So delicious. \n\nPanchos has become a frequent choice in my house and I'm always excited to try new dishes on their menu.

But when the food came out I was a little let down. The protein in my tacos was so burnt and they were incredibly small for the price you pay. I also really wish the tacos came with a lime and salsa to the side. The nachos were so barren I had mostly tortilla chips with very little toppings, it was also very small for $10. I'll definitely never order the nachos again if they stay that small and toppingless. I'll try some tacos again and see if they can do better, but I might still have to make the drive to Pancho's. I do not mean any of this in a harsh way, just hope to be heard so the business can grow and flourish. I will up my stars the next time I visit if it goes better.

They were even for projecting an old movie on the wall! The bathroom was super cute too! So hip!\n\nThey have really great prices! \n\nGreat service, everyone was helpful and friendly!

The tortillas are Store bought but go well with the flavors.\n\nGreen enchiladas weren't are favorite. They use mash potatoes instead of some protein..green sauce could have used more seasoning as well.\n\nWe had the free iced water self serve.

Being in the restaurant biz myself, I know that that first month or so is a time where you grow and learn and improve, so I have NO doubt in my mind, any \"kinks\" here will be worked out. \nFirst, Service wise, this is a spot that you can tell, the employees are happy to be working at. This says a lot for the management and owners too. Everyone I've encountered is friendly and knowledgeable and has welcomed me back. They come out and check on you and when the ordering line has been \"long\" other staff has come out on handheld pos systems and taken orders. \nSecond, Decor is great! Simple and clean and fun. White with black and teal. Little plants on the tables and just an overall fresh feeling spot. \nThird, and most importantly, Food. I have had a good majority of the tacos, a couple starters/sides, one entree and one dessert. \nSince I've had so much there, at this stage I'm having a hard time remembering what all I had on what day. But.... for the most part, everything has been great! Some of the tacos are smaller then others but I don't think any are overpriced or disappointing. With prices under $3 on almost every single taco, I don't understand how some people have complained that they are overpriced??? Most tacos are 2.50. What do people expect? This is a business that uses quality ingredients and doesn't pay their employees \"sweatshop\" wages. How on earth could they charge less for food that has homemade sauces and house pickled items and whatnot. People are crazy if they think 2.50 is overpriced for a good taco. Seriously, stay home or continue eating fast foods $1 menu, if that's your mentality. \nItems I've had:\nGabacho taco\nBarbacoa taco\nDorado taco\nBaja taco\nChicharron verde taco\nPlantains con Mole taco\nTakis Elote\nAsada Fries\nFlautas\nGuacamole\nChurros \n\nMy least favorite thing was the guacamole. I just was left wanting some that was reminiscent of some I know they make elsewhere...\nMy favorites: churros for sure!!!! Also the asada fries are filling and very satisfying. Almost too \"meaty\" in a way, but great for the non vegans for sure! Flautas were great and something I never order at Mexican restaurants but these were fun and filling! Came with rice and beans and pico and guacamole.\nTaco wise, I loved the Gabacho. Yes it is that standard taco that makes you think of having taco nite back in the day with the fam. Hard shell with the lettuce cheese and meat. The Plantain was flavorful and fun. And the chicharron was surprisingly good! I have NEVER liked chicharron before (when I ate meat) so wasn't sure how I'd like this, but it was great! \nI wish the takis elote had more cilantro. But I will admit I am a cilantro fiend so.... \u200d\nThey now have their alcohol license so beers will make dinner (or lunch) complete! \nI definitely recommend checking this place out, whether you eat meat or not.\nI also think the owners for opening on the south west, so that all of us do not have to drive to the Eastside for vegan tacos anymore!!!!"

We ordered 4 different tacos, chips and salsa, and elotes. I dived right into the carne asada taco, ARE YOU KIDDNG ME! I looked my fianc\u00e9 in the eyes and life was complete. Her beautiful smile and a vegan carne asada taco in my mouth. I didn't stop there, I finished every taco in front of me. Service was great, as I finished one they came and cleaned up the mess. I felt like I was on Henry Ford's general assemble line full of tacos. Once I caught my breathe I texted my family and friends and recommended they come here ASAP. Don't you dare think I didn't want more, I went back in line and ordered more! At this point my fianc\u00e9 thought I was disgusting with how much I had put in my belly in this 15 minute sitting. But with a smile from ear to ear she didn't mind to much. Don't think I ended with tacos, I also ordered the churros. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!

As you can see I'm not a fan at all. \nFirst off let's talk about what they do right: the staff at every location I've been to is very friendly and professional. They are courteous and quick and I've always had them get my order right. The locations are invariably clean as well. Kudos for that. \nThe problem for me is the food. I am a damn good cook - I make damn good food - and I'm from Texas. All of my grandparents were from Mexico and since I've been eating this food all my life I feel like I'm pretty well qualified to comment on this. Mexican food done right is the best food in the world. Done wrong - well if you haven't seen the episode of South Park where the dead celebrities are haunting Ike (Kyle's little brother) and Billy Mays's undead spirit is hawking Chipotle-Away because it can get the blood stains shooting from your ass at high velocity out of your underwear from the burrito you ate earlier - well let's just hope you don't ever experience the Mexican Screaming Shits. It's not pretty. It's actually pretty damn ugly. And it smells bad. Nuff said.\nThe food here is mediocre at best and I have found it's rarely at its best. I've tried a number of different items and each one is always greasy and covered in cheese. Now anyone who knows me knows my opinion on toppings, condiments and fillers. When they are the star of the meal, it's a sign of mediocre (at best) food. So why is everything on this menu loaded with it? Hmm...not a good omen but we'll see.\nI ordered a breakfast burrito here (sans cheese) and was less than impressed. Granted the sausage was ok - not great, not horrible, just kinda...meh. The burrito was hot and made to order, which is good. However, it was wrapped in a tortilla that felt like it had been slathered with lard and heated. How do you serve a greasy tortilla? REALLY??\nNow I've eaten at Roberto's several times since I moved here - my friends have always said it's great drunk food and the first few times I went I was a bit drunk so I guess I must not have noticed. The last bunch of times I've gone though I've been sober and every time I just like it less and less. I just cannot ignore that the only thing I usually taste is the cheese (which is not good at all since I'm lactose intolerant) and I'm just really not a big fan of things tasting cheesy. I had the burrito without it and - guess what - it was mediocre. It wasn't bad, it wasn't good, it was just...meh. Nothing about it shone. I couldn't even taste the pico de gallo which it was supposed to have. Hell I can buy a better burrito at Carl's Jr!\nThank you - but no. I don't think I'll be going back to Roberto's anymore unless I'm just desperate and can't find a Del Taco. It's really a shame, too. Oh Roberto's you had so much promise. Too bad you couldn't deliver."

I used to order the carne asada burrito (my dads favorite) but I don't care for the amount of onion in it and I always forget to aske them to leave it off.  Other highlights at Roberto's include the asada fries.  Think of them as nachos with fries instead of chips.  They are loaded with cheese, beans and carne asada.  I only ordered them once and that was enough for awhile.  They are insanely good but also monsterously big.  It was too much even for a big eater like me.  The same can be said about the chimichunga which I do at times order in a combo with rice and beans.  The beans are good but I can do without them.  The rice, on the other hand, is great and sometimes I just order a side of it because it is so good.  \n\nWhile the food quality at various Roberto's shops is pretty standard and equal to one another each location varies in its appearance and cleanliness.  This Roberto's which I go to most frequently is one of the cleanest I've seen.  I love coming in.  The only questionable area is the cold bar with the salsas, cucumber, radishes, green onions, limes and pickled jalapenos and carrots.  Despite the splatters of salsa soiling the stainless steel I still like to get some of the carrots, cucumber and radishes.  A nice refreshing crunch on the side with my tacos is sometimes just what the stomach ordered."

The onion cilantro mix is ridiculous as the onions are chopped way too big and there there is barely any cilantro seen. The menu says it comes with guacamole but this is just a green liquid that resembles a green salsa without the jalape\u00f1o kick. The 2nd taco dripped about 1 teaspoon of grease onto my plate which caused my tortilla to break as well. Also ordered a Horchata and I don't taste any cinnamon!

I usually don't like to review chain restaurants like this, but I don't know a group of guys who treat me better. \n\nI've probably eaten here over 100 times this year. The food is really good and the service is outstanding. I actually think this place is pretty close to authentic because they don't use ground beef in their tacos. \n\n9 out of 10 times I come here after midnight. On weekend nights, you get a lot of drunk girls in club dresses who are coming home from a night of drunken stupidity(I am hardcore straight-edge, so yes I believe people who drink alcohol are pathetic...and yes I'm talking to you reading this), and some will say racist remarks towards Mexican people. I can't count how many times I've had to sit here and listen to that. The Mexican-American workers here have a lot patience having to deal with that. I always tip them extra for having to endure that crap.\n\n9 out of 10 time I get the Al-Pastor fries!! It's a part of the secret menu so you won't find it on the board. They get french fries and put salsa, beans, sour cream, guacamole, and tons of Al Pastor on it. They also got 99 cent Taco Wednesday!!! \n\nThe guys work really hard here, especially Arturo. They keep it spotless and clean. The salsa bar is really upscale compared to other Mexican restaurants!  \n\nActually, I did review this place back in January of 2012, but the yelp filter kept eating my review...apparently the filter thinks I work here. Let me just say that the Yelp filter is a complete dumbsh!t because I don't work at ROBERTO'S TACO SHOP, I work at Burger King off of Martin Luther King and Eastern. If you don't believe me, ask Yelp Elite Jen G. She just happens to be assistant manager."

I have always had efficient, friendly service and they've never balked at my customization requests.\n\nHowever, when I can't enjoy but half of my chile relleno because it wasn't properly cleaned out? Not just a little bit near the top/end/etc... but half the chile had ribs and seeds. It made the dish bitter and inedible where it was present. \n\nAdd to this that my friend's nachos were wet and missing the cheese (really?) and they forgot her side of beans.\n\nHistory was already \"meh,\" and now #lunchfail.

I'm all about trying new things, and when one of my friends said she was craving beans, it only made sense to go here. We went through the drive-thru and ordered at the speaker. The menu is easy to read and full of options from tacos to street corn, and burritos to salad. I ordered the Pineapple Fresca which was cold and refreshingly sweet. I also tried the Strawberry which had small chunks of berry and seeds and wasn't overly sweet, but maintained the full flavor of the delicious fruit.\n\nWhat was disappointing was the Carnitas Burrito. It was loosely wrapped and had minimal chunks of meat. I love my carnitas a bit on the crispier side, and although the pork was full of flavor, the texture was soft, which made the whole burrito a bit of a mess to eat."

When we received our bag, I noticed there was a small box inside, instantly I thought, \"that's odd, how do our cups fit in this? Maybe it's someone else's food?\" So I opened the box up, and it had two corn ON THE COBS inside. Lol I was confused. The corn was lacking butter, and seemed to only have mayo and slight cheese. I instantly let her know, \"hey, umm I asked for corn in a cup\" then she began to tell me they don't carry corn in a cup, but they can cut this corn into a cup if I wanted. And \"no, that's fine, can I just have a refund\" so I handed her the receipt.  Because that wasn't what I wanted, especially if it was gonna look like that but just in a cup  And she was upset and rolled her eyes, then was EVEN MORE upset because she thought I only wanted a refund on the corn and handed me a receipt with the drinks still on it, when I let her know I didn't want ANYTHING,  (mind you, we didn't touch the drinks, they were still on the counter) she had to void the whole thing out, I can tell she was furious.

My work schedule has me by one location or another nearly every day of the week and it's hard to stay away on taco Tuesdays. The new drive-thru available makes this even harder, now that it's so fast.\n\nTheir asada is consistently smoky and fresh, one of my favorite versions in town, and their al pastor is my second-choice protein. All tacos come with the works, done right with cilantro, onion, and guac, with additional red and green salsa at each table. Sides include chips/salsa (which I wish were included) or rice/beans. Treat yourself to a tasty agua fresca with your meal- and if you can't decide on a flavor, they'll combine them all for you!"

They have your tradition horchata but they also have drinks with chia seeds.  It's quite different but tasty.\n\nOn my visit I ordered the carne asada nachos and a carne asada taco.  I made the mistake of not asking how their large tacos are prepared.  The taco is more of a folded up quesadilla with carne asada stuffed in the middle.  They add salsa and guac.  If you are a fan of those things, you will enjoy.  I, however, do not enjoy the texture of quesadillas so this was a bit off-putting for me.\n\nThe nachos are ok.  They are served with pinto beans (whole, not refried), carne asada, guacamole, sour cream, and salsa.  They taste great to start, but because the beans are too watery they make the chips soggy quickly.  I like my nachos to be crispy.  An improvement would be to serve the toppings on the side as a dip for the chips.  The carne asada I believe is cooked on a flat top so it doesn't get the char that a grill would provide.\n\nOverall, it's decent for a quick lunch and if you know how to order."

They have a hand written sign for taco pricing and a few pictures for their combos.\n\nI ended up getting two carne asada burritos and a large Jamaica for like $15. I have no complaints about the food what so ever. My food was ready before I was done filling up my four little salsa cups. The meat was very tender. Only thing is, if you don't like spicy foods like my bf, do not get any salsa at all! I had the red in my burrito and got green on the side for him. The green is suppose to mild but this one is a hot mild. Almost seemed a bit spicier than the red.\n\nI will be coming back. Think they have $0.70. Tacos on Wednesdays as well."

One place that comes in mind for good Mexican food just off the \"Strip\" is Tacos Mexico. \n\nIt is a very bright cafeteria style restaurant with a menu posted on a huge board that will take you a few minutes to figure what you want.  They have  a wide variety of meats and different ways to serve the tacos or burritos.  \n\nI had a huge carne asada burritos that was very tasty.  I think it cost something like $4!  What a bargain for sure!  I also had a large horchata drink.  Well, it was the size of a barrel!  All in all, a very filling meal that i could not finish no matter how hard I tried!  I was full until late the next day!\n\nBe warned, they do serve in large portions so come hungry.  If you decide to take the rest home or back to your hotel, be warned that the food may leak out of your bag and get all over the place.  \n\nSo, on my future trip to Las Vegas, I will have to catch a cab to this great Mexican restaurant.  I can't wait...of course, there are plenty of places I am looking forward to going to, but like last time, I managed to get here at 3 in the morning after an almost all night party!"

But since I came with some friends and was pretty hungry we gave it a shot. The front where you order is a super narrow walkway and the menu is along the wall. Prices are really cheap!! Instead of getting tacos, I opted for some sopes since I miss my boyfriend's mom's sopes haha. I got them Al Pastor and it cost $5.65 which isn't bad at all for a loaded plate!

Late 70s - 80's, before the majors \"...bertos\" , it eventually became places like Alberto's, Robertos, Adalbertos, Rombertos, etc... haha, you get the point. But as of late I used to think, Carne Asada Burritos weren't the same because, after countless times eaten over the decades, you just get desensitized and that's like with a lot of things from childhood. At least that's the excuse I had in my head. But the first time I ate here, the flavor of burrito struck a chord of memories, and deliciousness. Made me realize, that some of these so called big Mexican food chains, are getting over on us. Here's my observation after 4 times eating here. I watched the cook cook the meat. First, he did it the way I remembered as a kid, laid it on the grill, unchopped, then after cooked, then chopped (holds on to flavor better). If you notice, most of these \"..berto\" style joints or \"Don yadayada\" , prechop meat and cook it, let it sit in warm tub, and cook it again to order, (tough and grissel). That's the meat comparison. Now, out of the 4 times that I am basing my review, the one time I saw that meat already chopped in a tub used, it was not to great, but surprisingly, still better than the competition. Maybe because it's because it's cooked in that particular better sequence. The rest of other ingredients seem fresher as well. Sour cream and guacamole is thicker. Pico de gallo, seems very fresh as well. And price is a big plus!!\n\nBTW-Only negative(does not effect star rating cuz you just need to be aware), make sure you don't get beans and rice in burrito - it's a San Diego thing ;), taste much better. I grew up with that stuff on the side, I think it's much better that way anyways."

It also kinda helps too if I did more researches on things to do and places to eat and avoid when I visit any city. \"I know, that is why we have Yelp!\"\n\nThis place is opened 24 hours and a drive-thru, which are the only positives. But my $6.00 \"so called\" super burrito wasn't what I was expected for a city best known for good food. \n\nFirst of all, I love all my \"super burritos\" fat, juicy, and wrapped tightly in a aluminum foil. But my burrito from here was small and wrapped loosely. Therefore, all the key ingredients fell apart on me leaving a fat mess. The meat, beans, and rice were also dry. And the chips were stale.\n\nI'm an old man and still play with my food. So I dissected my burrito and noticed, \"I got ripped off.\" The shop didn't give me any cheese, guacamole and sour cream. If I wanted those fillings in my super burrito, according to menu I have to pay extra. Now I got it.  \n\nI ended up throwing 3/4 of that burrito away and left just finishing my Sidral Mundet sparkling Apple drink, which was refreshing.\n\nTo find a decent \"super\" burrito in another city continues."

Outside the signs don't fully light up and inside is fairly messy.  There are some arcade machines in a corner, some working, some not, and the lighting is overly bright.  There is a drive-thru, but it's the type where you drive up to the window and order -- there is no microphone or anything.  \n\nDespite appearances, the food is good when it's made correctly.  I've gotten tacos, of which you can get a lot of different types and flavors of beef and chicken, and quesadillas which offer the same choices.  With the quesadillas they come with nacho chips, beans, and lettuce.  Every time I've gone there and asked for it without lettuce they always put the lettuce in anyway.  I've resorted to telling them I'm allergic to lettuce, even though I'm not, but it seems to make no difference.  I'm sorry but I don't like lettuce and I don't want my quesadilla covered in it and soggy.  One time I gave it back to them and told them I didn't want lettuce and watched the cook open the box, take some of the lettuce out, close it up and give it back to me.  Yuck.\n\nSo, I try to keep it simple and just get tacos now.  Prices are good and it's both cheaper and a lot better and much more authentic than places like Taco Bell.  As a plus they are open 24 hours."

Corn tortilla, meat of choice, onions, cilantro and salsa, what else you need? NADA. I will say that the patsor is only okay and the chicken is not that great, haven't tried anything else there.

I understand Spanish, so I do not care about that, but a guy came up behind her and told her that he would wait on me. Anyway, I ordered a California Burrito with no pico.  A normal California Burrito has steak, French Fries, cheddar cheese and pico.  However when I got the burrito, it didn't have the pico which was good.  However, it had no cheese and the fries were half cooked.  And the cook kept on asking the clerk questions about the orders.  It also took a lot longer than Roberto's.

The order should have been $5.75 and tax, however, I gave my debit card and was charged $8.16.

I was quite surprised my order was correct, just not the pricing.\n\nThe next morning I called the restaurant and was told Manwell was the manager and to get a hold of him I would have to call around 7:00 a.m. to get a hold of him.  I tried this morning and got several people who could not understand me to finally find someone who could speak to me in English to tell me his name is Javier and he was the manager.

We imbibed carafe after carafe of a delicious sangria. I took note.\n\nThis year, at the end of a traditional/annual BFF/coworker trip, Sarah E, Sarah M, KarKar, and I spent an extra day in Vegas, the start of which led us to this same spot for lunch, touting it's sangria. It did not disappoint my hazy recollection.\n\nWe were quickly seated by the hostess, the restaurant/\"patio\" on the waterfront being sparsely occupied on a Tuesday afternoon. Julio, our server - an elder but spirited gentleman - came over with menus, introduced himself, and immediately prompted us for drinks to start...\n\"A pitcher of sangria, please?\"\n\"Excellente. Four glasses?\n\"Yes, please. Thank you.\"\n\nWith drinks on their way and requisite chips & salsa on the table, lunch/sustenance was in order. Both Sarahs ordered the Tres Tacos plates while KarKar went with lighter fare, having a bowl of the Corn & Green Chile Soup. I ordered the smoked chicken quesadilla, thinking it would be like... um, one big quesadilla, but they (3) were [pleasantly] more akin to grill flattened/pressed tacos.\n\nThe Corn & Green Chile soup was flavorful! A bit of sweet from the corn, heat from the green chile, a hearty fullness of potato, and depth/salt from smoked bacon.\n\nThe taco combination platters and the smoked chicken quesadilla plate satisfying and freshly flavored. Each taco was dressed with toppings complimentary to their filling - shredded chicken salpicon, mushrooms with queso blanco/fresco, and [grilled] fish with a pineapple salsa. The three palm-sized smoked chicken quesadillas are heavy with chicken and cheese. Both platters come garnished with a sharp and tangy serano slaw, black beans, and fresh flavorful cilantro rice.\n\nBack to what brought us here... the Sangria.\n\nNow its hard to tell (especially in Vegas) just how good/effective a sangria can be. It's *meant* to creep, right? (JM, Cobes, and I went 2-3 carafes not realizing the fade!) But I must say, the sangria here is good. Not too tart, not too sweet. Retains the silken feel of red wine and the warm flush of brandy is subtle. It's a slow ride into troubled waters. What a perfect way to ease into the crazy. Gimme more!\n\nSafe to say, for casual dining, good people watching, and a creeper of a drink, I'd gladly add Canonita to the yearly tradition.\n_________________________________________________\nNo, really. I have a note to myself on my phone from last year...\n \"Must do Sangria again!\"\nI don't remember writing it."

This restaurant is contained within the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas, directly aligned with their Grand Canal, with gondolas floating by, gondoliers singing, a ceiling painted with sky and clouds, false building fronts as if you are outside in Venice,.... After flying into Vegas, this was a heavenly place to drop in, get a bite to eat, before driving to a hotel to prepare for a several day conference.  There used to be a different restaurant with an \"outdoor patio\" near the canal and gondolas, but they seem to have shifted things, so I chose this restaurant based upon it's location.  \n\nThey had a nice selection on their menu.  I ordered the Ahi tuna medallions with polenta cakes, and a Sangria swirl type of drink.  I did not want to leave.  It looked like they also had a good menu for breakfast, but I was not staying near enough to come back.  \n\nVegas is a hectic place.  If you want a little bit of peace and tranquility, this is an excellent choice to unwind and have a bite to eat or drink!"

It didn't seem fresh at all and I have had some killer ceviche (at La Mer in San Fran) and made ceviche with Iron Chef Jose Garces. Yes, I actually MADE shrimp ceviche with an Iron Chef but that's a story for another day or one you can read on my blog. :) The quacamole and chips and salsa were tasty. The chicken flautas were good. I still love flautas from Chevy's (they are just yummy unauthentic goodness) so I compare theirs to everyone. The view of the canal is what really sells this place. We had great seats to listen to the gondola singers--their voices are amazing. I do not know how they sing all day. Ok, I digress, Taqueria Canonita was good for the Happy Hour and ok for food.

We weren't sure if we wanted to sit and eat so they brought us menus to look over while we watched the chef make corn tortillas by hand. The manager saw us staring at the chef and brought us two fresh hot tortillas to have. That sold us! They were so delicious and the people were so nice we decided to sit down. \n\nThey have a great happy hour! $5 drinks! We got two each of the RumChata and the PassionFuit Margarita. Both delicious drinks!! You have to like Horchata to like the Rumchata. \n\nThe food was delicious!!  \n\nThe Barbacoa was melt in your mouth amazing with the sauces and the tender pork! Oh I dream about that dish! It also came with the house made tortillas, which we were in love with! Which was paired perfectly with the Spinach and Manchengo salad. Loved every bite! \n\nIt is located right on the end of the canal towards one end of the shops. You are away from the public but get a great serenade by the gondoliers every time one of them float by.  The space is large and has patio-esque seating. (Where you think you are outside but aren't really.) \n\nI would love to go back here! Kudos to the staff and the servers! All amazing!"

Excellent Mexican food that will satisfy all types of pallets with a variety of traditional and unique flavorful dishes.\n\nHighly recommend the Tuna Ceviche Tostado with cilantro topping for an appetizer. Its so fresh and spicy. Also a must get is the Santa Rosa Pork Barbacoa which just falls off your fork and melts in your mouth with barbecue sauce.  Another favorite was the wild mushroom enchilada. I also got the Coco Pina drink served in a cute coconut shell which was amazing too.\n\nThe service was excellent and the ambiance was great. Will be back for sure."

We were seated \"outside\" under the Venetian's ceiling next to their version of the Grand Canal. It's a great place for people watching - you can see the gondolas row by and hear the gondoliers singing.\n\nThe focus is on food from Mexico City. The queso fundido appetizer was excellent, as was the Mexican sandwich (torta). The pitchers of margaritas are generous. \n\nThe service was great and the waiter clearly adjusted when we made it clear we wanted to linger over our margaritas."

Fast Mexican joints are arguably the best thing this world has to offer. They're open late, fill you up for cheap, and the food always tastes amazing. \n\nThis place has a menu full of classics. But carne asada fries seem to be their specialty as they've earned a rightful spot at the center of the menu board, and that's what I ordered.

The lady who took our order rushed over to apologize for our food being late and then brought it to our table minutes later along with a free drink. Great service for a fast food place!\n\nThe fries came PACKED in its takeout box- it was heavy!! But quality was not sacrificed for quantity as it was mindblowingly good. The beautiful cubes of steak were cooked to perfection- so tender and juicy, melted in my mouth like butter. The fries were crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and were made even better by the cheese and sour cream. These carne fries are also available with added shrimp for a few extra bucks. \n\nAlso tried their rolled tacos. To my surprise they were stuffed with quality shredded beef instead of sketchy ground beef. Served with cheese, guac, and a generous helping of lettuce and pico. Even with added yummy yellow salsa they were kinda bland, but at only $4 can you really ask for much? \n\nViva el Taco Express is dang near perfect besides the below average rolled tacos. Mind blowing carne asada fries, good service, unbelievably clean space (spotless dining area and even the restrooms smell great!), and open almost all day from 7 AM til midnight. 5/5!"

I usually get my Mexican food fix from my best friend's family nowadays. \n\nViva El Taco has the same concept of a Roberto's but it just taste better in my opinion. They have all your tacos, burritos, and plate combos. Viva also has some of the most solid street tacos in Vegas. When I say solid I am referring to their consistency and ability to satisfy a taco craving lol The Freshness, flavor, and convenience factors are there. They even ask if you want your tripas crispy or soft which is my gold standard of taco eating lol Their tripas and tongue are my recommendations for tacos.\n\nI'm all for waiting for good food, but It's seriously so nice being up the street from a good taco place where I don't have to wait in a huge line. Their salsa bar is also always cleaned, stocked, and looking fresh and full. I also dig that their staff is pleasant and actually look happy to be at work. Given their quick service, affordable prices, and store upkeep I don't have any criticism. Just a solid little Mexican joint."

The countertops are glistening and decor is vibrant yet sleek. \n\nThe first time I came here, I got the tostada de ceviche and was blown away by the flavor and portion. For under $5 it's huge! The ceviche is sandwiched between 2 tostadas. Each bite gives you that crunch from the tostada, freshness of the shrimp, nice acidity from the lime, and light creaminess from the sliced avocados. Heaven in my mouth! \n\nMy most recent trip, I ordered the 3 rolled up tacos with guacamole and cheese. I wasn't expecting a taquito to be so delicious. If you've ever had an elote, the flavor is uniquely similar to that. They slab on delicious guacamole, shredded cheese, and I think cotija cheese on top. I added some pickled onions and salsa from the salsa bar and it really elevated the whole thing. The pickled onions are one of my favorite condiments at the salsa bar. It's tangy and spicy, and best of all - free! \n\nThe salsa is also amazing on its own. They recently added the medium roasted salsa during my last visit. I can honestly say they are all worth trying. I can't pick a favorite, so I end up rotating between the 3 salsas after each bite of my taquito topped with pickled onion.\n\nThey also offer agua frescas.  They've included pineapple, jamaica (hibsicus), horchata, and Pepino Limon (cucumber/lemon). I tried the pepino limon and it was quite refreshing. It didn't taste like cucumber lemon to me though, it tastes like it had a hint of honeydew. Either way, it was good for these hot Vegas days that are soon upon us. \n\nThis place is so good, I came for lunch and shared some rolled tacos with my mom as a light snack. After grocery shopping, we came home and talked about how good the rolled tacos were, we went back and got 2 more order of it!"

He found Fatburger across the way, but neither one of us was in the mood for THAT. What he wanted was good Mexican food, which sounded alright to me.  That's when I remembered that a co-worker of mine, who's also a local, RAVED about Roberto's.  We'd already seen a few of them around, but hadn't yet taken the plunge, so it was settled.\n\nNOW I get the raves.  Quality-wise, this is DA MUY BUENO BOMB-DIGGETY. Bear had the chicken burrito - which was HUGE - while I settled on the chicken chimichanga, which was REDONKULOUS. Paired with a beef quesadilla, it looked (and felt like) enough to feed an army...and at a reasonable price! Yet unlike your typical fast Mexican food, say, that place with the bell and the chihuahua? THIS was good stuff, yet not at all heavy or greasy.  It took some time to finish so we didn't have leftovers, (which we couldn't have taken with us, anyway), but I didn't feel like I needed the entire defensive line of the Atlanta Falcons to help roll my ass outta there when we were done.\n\nThe place was pretty clean and the service surprisingly fast for a place run by just two guys behind the counter.  As a local myself now, I sure am glad there's a bazillion Roberto's around town, so we can find one whenever we need one!"

The only reason why I gave this place a star is because the guy at the cash register was extremely friendly however I'm on the hunt for some good Mexican food I come across this place not too far from my house it has a decent amount of stars I get in there and ask the guy for a chicken burrito with he asked me do I want shredded or grilled I said shredded  I asked the guy if it came with cheese he said he don't know((WTF)) you work here you getting paid for this what do you mean you don't know!!!!! so I did not get rude keep in mind it's one o'clock in the afternoon and I have not eaten all day so my attitude is not the best right now ...so I say well what comes on the burrito he says chicken and tomatoes((WTF)) I said ...no onions no cilantro ???he said yeah that too I said okay will let me have a chicken burrito with and let me add sour cream and cheese ....I get the burrito is wrapped up in foil that's not how a eet burrito comes ((WTF)) by this time I'm just ready to walk out I get home I'll take a bite into the burrito all I get is chicken.... I'm like okay sometimes the good stuff be in the middle... I take another bite of the burrito I get chicken sour cream and cheese my third bite of the burrito chicken cheese sour cream so I open it up there's nothing in the burrito!!!!!! but cheese and sour cream ((WTF))where is the onions and cilantro where's the tomatoes he told me about ??????? like if I would not have asked for cheese and sour cream would I only got chicken in a tortilla???

Sorry, the hot sauce is self serve, no tiny pre-packaged plastic tubs thrown into your bag. \n\nThe folks working here could use a little more personality, in the kitchen there's a stack of tortillas 3 feet high, the burritos are smaller than what I see in SoCal, the prices are about the same and the joint is cleaner than most. \n\nIt helps they put up photos of the food on the overhead menu. \n\nThe ignorant Gringos who frequent Taco Bell have no idea what to order.\n\nI was shocked, my relatives who live 3 miles from here for the past 15 years never tried this place before. \n\nI was ready to throw a spicy carrot slice at them."

One expects they do not have exacting standards for all their locations as you will often find differences in the recipe from one shop to another. \n\nOf course, the service will always differ between the various locations around the city. But this Roberto's, in a rather unassuming neighborhood of East Vegas, offers an excellent mix of all the good things you come to expect from the chain.\n\nA recent remodeling may have had an impact on this place. I don't know what it looked like before, but it looks good now and I think that has an affect on the staff as they are friendly and do an all-around good job. \n\nThe food is as good as any location in town and the portions and price are what have made Roberto's a local favorite."

The place was very clean, spacious, and there's plenty of seating there if you want dine-in. \n\nIn addition to the Carne Asada fries, I ordered two Carne Asada burritos, and four chicken tacos ($1 on Wednesday's). The burritos come with only steak, guacamole, and salsa. To me, they were just OK. The meat didn't have the grilled flavor or much flavor. I also wish they'd add rice or cheese or just something else to the burritos. I will say that they are a decent size, though. Very filling. As for the chicken tacos- the meat was dry and flavorless but they give you plenty of it. And, they're only a $1 on Wednesday's, so I guess I can't complain too much. To add flavor I just added the green sauce that they have in the self serve area. \n\nMy daughter loved the Carne fries! We even went back today to get her some. The fries looked amazing! Lots of meat, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and picco. They come with beans too, but she requested they exclude them. You get so much! \n\nI like how they place utensils, straws, and napkins out so that customers can get the amount they need instead of having to ask for it. \n\nAs long as my daughter keeps wanting their fries, and service is up to par, then I'll be back. She loves this place."

Ya, the food was okay, and the place was... eh.\n\nBut I came here today for a torta and the shop is really nice. The tables are clean and the entire kitchen has been turned around. The employees are nice too and my food was served up quick. I was the only one there at the time.\n\nI ordered a carne asada torta with everything. I enjoyed this torta. I felt as though it was well made, like they actually put thought into it. I have had so many tortas that I felt were just thrown together and the guac was dripping out the sides, the pico was all runny and gross. But not this torta! It helps that it was wrapped up very tightly in the waxy-paper and then the aluminum foil. Plus the bread was hefty. It wasn't a light bread. Therefore, even though the sandwich is juicy, the bread is holding up to it. I have had a lot of tortas when I got to the bottom I just tossed the damn thing because the bread was SO mushy and gross. Not this torta. The bread was only just a bit of mush, so I could eat it with no problem.\n\nI didn't realize this Roberto's had had a little renaissance. Now that I know, I'll probably be back more than once every 4 years."

There is about 4-5 small tables inside and perhaps at least 3-4 tables arranged outdoor. The restaurant is open for breakfast. And lunch hour is usually their busiest time. They offer breakfast and lunch combo plates, and they have a selection of burritos, tortas, tacos, quesadillas, seafood, and soup. Also they make specialty drinks like Horchata, Limonada, Tamarindo, and Jamaica.\n\nI chose the Grilled Chicken Fajitas combo plate ($8.99) which include tender chicken stir fry with green pepper, onion, tomato, and is serve with Spanish rice, refried beans, a small salad, sour cream and guacamole. The Chicken Fajitas include tortillas, you have a choice of flour or corn. I prefer corn tortilla, and I like that they serve it warm. The salsa verde is mild and it's not too spicy. I can tell the food is freshly made, the meat and vegetables are so flavorful, and everything in my combo plate taste amazing! Also I tried the Champurrado ($2.50), it's a thick Mexican Hot Chocolate, it has corn flour, cinnamon, clove, and star anise which gives out a calm and comforting flavor. The drink is serve hot and it's very satisfying.\n\nThey do have friendly and fast service. The person who place my order is Maria, and she made sure to check in with every customer. Price is reasonable and you can afford to order more. The staff is quick to make the food and it is delivered within 10-15 minutes. So far this restaurant is now my go-to spot for Real Authentic Mexican Fast Food."

They do have signage on the street directing you to their shop. Walking in, it's very small. There are a few tables inside and a walk up counter, but you can also call your order in for pickup.\n\nI ordered the taco combo which comers with 3 tacos, rice and beans, but I was hangry so I ordered an extra taco and fideo soup. The tacos I tried were asada and pastor, both yummy, but I liked the pastor better. I was given two squirt bottles of sauce, one green and one red. The green was mild and paired well with the tacos. The red was tasty too, but a little spicy as reds tend to be. The food came out quickly and tasted fresh and delicious. I am looking forward to returning and trying their other items."

We placed a $40 order with Uber eats and they missed one of the items we ordered , a shrimp burrito. I understand mistakes happen that is not my issue. The issue comes from the worst customer service I have ever experienced from someone when they admired to their error. We called asking for a solution and she snapped at me telling me what do you want me to do about it we were busy, deal with it. She did not offer any solution but telling us we can drive our lazy asses to the store to pick it up or suck it up. I asked for a manager she told me no! I asked her is this how she treats customers, we ordered Uber eats for convenience now our entire meal is messed up and one member of my family is missing out.

The meat was so favorable and tasted fresh, I ended up eating all the tacos and was not able to eat too much of the rice/beans that I had ordered even though they tasted really good too.

I wanted to sample a little bit of their menu so I ordered: carne asada tacos, rolled tacos, and carne asada fries.

I came here yesterday and idk if it's because I was sooooo hungry but the food was delicious. I ordered 2 carne asada tacos, nothing special because it's my safe food when I try a new Mexican joint. The tortillas appear to be handmade, nice and thick so they don't fall apart when you load up on sauce. The meat was seasoned perfectly. Huge portion comes with pico, and guac. I got some spicy red sauce for them and ohhhh sweet Jesus was it delicious. The 2 tacos I ordered came out to about $6 because they're not your average taco truck tacos. These things were massive. He gave them to me in a carne asada nachos container to be able to hold both. Super yum. I'll definitely be back. Sooo glad Baja Taco is gone or under new management because they sucked the big one back when they were open."

I don't know, though The food was okay and the service was okay and the prices are okay, but that's really all I can say about it...it's okay. I will say that, when I was in, their salsa/veggie bar was absolutely wrecked.

I digress, back to the Roberto's Yelp.\n\nI was working in the area and have been to this location several times, but had never Yelped them. I usually have the carne asada burrito, lunch special. For $7.35, you get a carne asada burrito, sides of rice and beans, with a drink. This is what I had today.\n\nThe burrito is filled with carne asada and avocado, very tasty, The sides of rice and beans, beans a little above average, rice average. Soda was the Pepsi genre.\n\nI gave three stars, which is an average rating, which I consider them to be. But, I have Yelped many Mexican restaurants, as of late, many were so below average, I would seek out average. I like the food here, it tastes good, you get plenty, at a reasonable price, can't ask for much more than that. So if you're in the area, give them a try. If you're a Roberto's fan, this location is about average for them, I've been to better, been to worse, but in general the Roberto's are consistent, I recommend them."

We get there, and the gentlemen who work there said we were late picking up our food. They said over the phone it would be ready in 10 mins, but we got there in 20 mins after the order was placed.

Thing is loaded with all the sides you need for your meal - pickled carrots, sliced cucumbers, sliced radishes, jalapenos, limes, heck..even stalks of fresh green onion!  Their red & green salsas are good as well.  Stock up!\n\nWhat the fam & I usually order doesn't change much when we visit any Roberto's.  We'll stick with the popular carne asada burrito or the machaca burrito (I do like breakfast for dinner), the rolled tacos or carne asada nachos or chicken tacos (don't forget their $1 chicken taco Wednesdays), and I feel like a change one of their tortas.\n\nBut no matter what we get it's a decent quick meal.  Watch out though...the fillings in the burritos can be DAMN HOT!  They literally cook it, place it in a warm tortilla, then send it out.  Tasty, tasty, but watch your mouth!  Enough to cause some heat backlash.  Be dainty like me if you have to...cut the burrito in half to let out some of that steam!\n\nTheir red & green salsas accompany their food very well.  I can't really decide which one I like better so I always douse my food with some of both.  Delegation, y'all!  Their carne asada nachos are actually quite HUGE, they really give more meat than chips in this one.  And they pile on the cheese...not to mention the sour cream & guac!  Like a massive spoonful of each.  Fatty city, here I come!  But really, they taste good enough I just don't care.  I'll just eat a side of some of Roberto's raw veggies from the salsa bar to even it out a bit.  \n\nDon't start on those rolled tacos.  They are no doubt fatty, fat cholesterol bombs!  KABOOM!  Rolled tacos, covered, and I mean COVERED in shredded cheddar cheese & topped of with generous amounts of sour cream & guac.  Get yourself a defibrillator if you're eating an order of these along with a burrito or nachos.  Oily goodness!

Well...\n\n1. The staff isn't particularly friendly.  They aren't mean or rude, but they aren't very welcoming either.\n\n2. I do like it, but I don't make a huge effort to go there, which means it is just ok in my book.

We order a lunch special which is $5 comes with 5 tacos at random and a small drink, one there torta. Everything was absolutely amazing!!!!

Only complaint is that the fries needed more cheese but I'm sure you can order extra cheese or ask for the nacho cheese. \n\nOne more thing I would suggest is having a salsa bar so guests can help themselves to different salsas like most taquerias have.

My chile relleno and taco plate took a while, but her breakfast burrito came at least 15 minutes after mine. My taco was pretty greasy, but tasted okay. My chile relleno was still cold inside where the cheese was still a solid slice. The beans and the rice on the side was good. The salsa bar had fresh radishes which I love, but the pickled carrot/jalapeno mixture used cooked carrots which were no longer crunchy. Maybe because it was busy, the place was not cleaned up and people left messes on the tables that no one cleaned. When exiting, they only use one of the doors so now you get to manuever between the line and the glass wall trying to get out where people are coming in for the mad dash at lunch.

No guessing is needed, unlike some restaurants in the city where the names are not recognizable. Leaving you wishing the whole time if you could ask Alexa \"what does this mean\"? Selected the green chicken chili fries, but only because the cashier sold me on the juices from the green chicken chili sealing into the fries. Her recommendation was valid, and on the fries where there wasn't a mountain of cheese, sour cream, onions, salsa, and green chicken chili, the juices helped to prevent a mouth full of dry potatoes.

My first order was for a Carnitas Torta. The carnitas has zero seasoning and the bread base was literally soaked in liquid (I'm assuming juice from the meat) and soggy falling apart. How you can even call that a Torta is beyond me.\n\nMy second visit today the food was just as terrible. Ordered the Chili Rellenos/Cheese Enchilada combo plate. The breading on the CR was spongy and had a slight bite to it, the chili and cheese inside were molten hot, like this was not a freshly made item but something that had been cooked up a day ago and popped in the microwave. Then you get the enchilada which was a plain corn tortilla stuffed with un-melted cheddar cheese. This was all drenched in what tasted like a canned red sauce, topped with cheese and lettuce (which wilted from the heat of the food). \n\nI was so looking forward to a qsr mexican restaurant in the area, but I was disappointed to get something with such horrible food quality.\n\nAfter these two experiences I'd rather go to Taco Bell before I'd venture back here."

Patience is definitely needed, along with suggestions from someone familiar (ie. the cashier). Colorful and very pictorial field menus make selection of lunch (breakfast options too) options easy. No guessing is needed, unlike some restaurants in the city where the names are not recognizable. Leaving you wishing the whole time if you could ask Alexa \"what does this mean\"? Selected the green chicken chili fries, but only because the cashier sold me on the juices from the green chicken chili sealing into the fries. Her recommendation was valid, and on the fries where there wasn't a mountain of cheese, sour cream, onions, cilantro, and green chicken chili, the juices helped to prevent a mouth full of dry potatoes. The menu and food combinations is so plentiful, I can see spending multiple lunch ones here within the next couple months and never have the same thing twice."

I told someone that took my order (not wearing a company shirt) and she came back about 3-4 minute's later with a little paper boat with Very EXTREMELY hot beans and rice. Just like it was microwaved. Both items felt the same temp. Which made the rice very soggy and inedible. \n\n\nSo I MAY come back in a few months and try again. It could be growing pains...

We miss the old Island style burrito place that used to be here. \n\nWe waited about 8-10 minutes to order and than well over 20 minutes for our food and it was not that busy. When we did receive our food it was not anything remotely special or difficult to put on a plate. Now if the food was amazing I could forgive the horribly long wait, but this food is just not that good at all. The street tacos my girlfriend ordered were just meat on a corn tortilla no cilantro... no nothing at all. The tortillas were cold as well. I ordered the Carne Asada Nachos. Wow, this establishments idea of nachos is chips just barely sprinkled with meat, cheese, tomatoes, and a little sour cream. All chips and no additional ingredients. \n\nI witnessed another gentleman leave after waiting just as long or longer than we did. Then it looked as if the owner or manager brought out the wrong order and had to take it back to the kitchen. Well this guy had enough and he decided this just wasn't for him. \n\nI am never too harsh and never allow myself to get too disappointed when it comes to trying something new, but Fun Taco is anything but fun and I am not sure if they have any idea what they are doing when it comes to the food or the service. This is the first time I have ever been so adamant on writing a review. Please do not waste your time or money at Fun Taco. \n\nJust stop down the street at Roberto's. At least you know what you are getting.\n\n**UPDATE** I am pretty confident I just received what was meant to be an insulting response from the owner or an employee of Fun Taco's who goes by Jose M. Just another indication of the absolute disregard for the customer and their place of business as a whole. BEWARE OF FUN TACO'S!!!"

The huevos were on crunchy shells which makes me happy :) The salsa was a little watery, but had some zing to it. The beans were great! Rice was a little dry & crunchy. The kids loved their quesadillas, but the guacamole tasted a little bland and was missing those delicious chunks of avacafo, tomato & onion we are used to. Kids meals come with churro or fries - we opted for the churro. It's a bit dough-y, but has that familiar cinnamon sugar taste. Definitely want to try the tacos next time."

I was thinking \"cool, somewhere close to get a breakfast burrito and lunch.\" So, I go in for lunch today, I didn't have breakfast so I was real hungry. I glanced over the menu and ordered the carne asada nachos. I love carne asada nachos from Roberto's, so I figured I'd try these ones. It took about 10 minutes before the cashier handed me my food and I was on my way back to work to eat. I remove the styrofoam container and opened it up. Needless to say, I was not impressed. It looked like I ordered from the children's menu. So few chips that I could see the bottom of the container, it was about a handful of chips. The amount of carne asada was unbelievable. It was equivalent to the amount you'd have on one street taco. It looked like they sprinkled it on. If the price was $3.49, I'd be ok with it, but $7.99 for that meal? What a rip off. It actually tasted pretty good, just not fair price for what was equal to an order of chips with some cheese an a few pieces of meat. That location has been jinxed for years. I'd honestly be surprised if Fun Tacos is still open by the end if the year. You can travel a few blocks in multiple directions from there and find better Mexican food that actually gives you a fair serving of food for your money. \nAnd while I'm reviewing this restaurant, why do they have an apostrophe in \"tacos\"? Do they possess or own something? I know I got owned today. I had to have a co worker bring me sandwich an hour later after eating my lunch."

Have you folks never had real Mexican food? \n\nMy boyfriend and I tried this place for the first time last night and we were not impressed.\n\nThis place is NOT real Mexican food. The beans had a grey milky tint to them and were entirely flavorless. The tortilla was soggy. Seriously, how do you mess up a bean and cheese burrito?!? What are these... Fake beans? Powdered beans? Yuck Yuck Yuck!! \n\nMy boyfriend ordered a quesadilla and it looked like a taco.\n\nI noticed they were advertising some seasonings and thought it was odd. \n\nWe got an order of carne asada fries and they were terrible. First of all, who the hell makes carne asada fries with big fat steak fries?!? Yuck! The carne asada looked like chili and was very sausey. To top it off it was loaded with their seasoning. Yuck! Since when does carne asada fries have seasoning? I mean these were covered in a disgusting seasoning. The seasoning is really not appropriate for this dish. I'm fairly certain this was one of the seasonings advertised. Maybe some people like it, but it wasn't for us.\n\nI gave it two stars because the place was really clean inside and the hot sauce was great. The service was also really good. \n\nThis appears to be a one man show. I can see how that could be a problem at times. \n\nPerhaps I'm so disappointed because I'm from San Diego and know what real Mexican food tastes like! \n\nI really wish the owner would consider using higher quality ingredients. \n\nThis place just isn't for us. Everything was a few dollars more than other places. With so many other taco shops to choose from, we won't be returning."

The only reason they are getting the extra star is the lady was very friendly. I always try the carne asada burrito at a new place and my one pet peeve is meat quality. Every single bite I took , the meat was fatty and just plain poor quality. I spit out at least 5 bites and frankly I was not pleased. I don't care if you want to charge me more money don't serve me garbage it's disgusting,unpleasant and petty.  Invest in quality and you will earn loyalty. With this you earn nothing but bad word of mouth. Not much else to say."

They have pictures of some items and my mouth watered as soon as I saw pictures of the torta!\nThere was one guy working and he was super friendly and had great customer service. \nThe seating is limited but I went at night so I was the only one there with my boyfriend. I appreciated that the food was super fresh and I could see him cooking it. I've had problems at Robertos where the food is sitting and then just slabbed in a tortilla and put on the grill.\nMy torta was very flavorful, I enjoyed the things that came on it (pico, guac, sour cream) but what ruined it was the carne asada. While the flavors were great, the meat itself was cut thick and just SUPER chewy. I thought I was being picky until my boyfriend said the same thing. It made it really difficult to eat and enjoy because it took so much effort to bite in and rip the meat apart...not to mention the work of chewing tough thick carne asada! \nThe salsas they offer were all delicious..i couldn't differentiate which one was best because they were all great. One however was very spicy, if you enjoy heat you will probably enjoy it because it isn't unbearable...just really hot!\nI also ordered a horchata and 3 caramel churros. The horchata was a typical horchata, nothing amazing about it. The churros were fresh and delicious but I honestly couldn't taste or feel any of the caramel inside. I complain because I ate all 3 and they were so good!\nOverall I wish I had went with tacos..I love tacos el gordo and pinches tacos so I was hoping to find another competitor. Haven't decided if I will go back to try more!"

We live in RI and came to Vegas for a week anyhow my hubby is Israeli and Everytime we leave home our search for good Israeli food begins.  We come to Vegas almost every year and usually eat next door but we had no idea panini was open for bfast... Most Israeli places here open at 11 and we want to have real bfast not buffet ... Anyhow we got here at 10 an Israeli lady named Gila  greeted us she was so charming and immediately the Hebrew started flowing my husband's eyes lit up.... ( He felt home lol) anyhow they have everything !!! We ordered hummus, a panini toast with emek cheese ( Israeli cheese) and abtwist of pesto for mua! Lol anyhow it came with a salad and delish.... Hence we couldn't finish it and taking everything to the track( my hubby is racing ) we also ordered shakshuka which was perfectly spiced up.... I love harif!! ( Spicy food) then we ordered Israeli salad which was great usually other places don't season it but this one had lemon salt and olive oil... The first thing that came out was a trio of salads red cabbage , corn and babaganoosh... the three were fresh and the baba it was home made you could feel the grilled eggplant... Which I love a lot of places simply buy it but when I taste the grill well it's a home run to me! Then oshri came... I think he's the owner and if not he was so nice and had great attention to detail which is a plus... I studied hospitality and attention to the small details always get to me.... In others words if u want Israeli food def come by it def reminded me of being home!!! Thank u panini cafe I will be back tomorrow morning ;)"

I tried his which were pretty good, but I'm still pretty partial to tacos el gordo. The fish tacos though were banging! They had a delicious hickory sauce on top and were huge portions.

There is one four top to sit at, a couple of two tops and a bar to sit at. We needed the four top and luckily the people ahead of us left. Good smells flowing from the kitchen made my taste buds perk up!\n\nBoth my brother in law and I opted for the taco plate. I had a fish and pollo taco and he had the carne asada. My hubby ordered the enchiladas. We enjoyed some chips and salsa too. Their salsa is really flavorful and they offer both hot and mild. I tried all of them and really liked the one that had a smoked taste and a nice kick at the end. Just a hole in the wall with some very authentic tasting Mexican food. I have driven by multiple times and never even noticed this place but it is on my radar for another try."

Other great choices are the burritos and the tortas although for at least one member of the family the chipotle salsa was too hot. Speaking of which, I also really like the salsa bar because it has not only 1, but 4 interesting choices. The only somewhat negative note was for the asada nachos which didn't come with as much meat as we're used to."

They were extremely nice people. After bragging to my wife about how huge and tasty the fish tacos were, she wanted me to go back the next day to get her one. I came back and was helped by their son, and had a nice chat with him too.  He offered me a taste of their braised beef and it was melt-in-your-mouth tender. (Have to wait until next time to get this, since I already pre-ordered). My wife, who doesn't particularly favor Mexican food, loved the fish tacos. \n\nCan't get a better taco or deal anywhere than this place, particularly the fish tacos. You should order on your way there since they make these to order and it takes at least 10 min to fry. This is a great little neighborhood treasure and a great family-owned, authentic taco spot."

So let's get started, first off the location is perfect it's right in the middle of everything you'll be doing on Fremont. \n\nThe atmosphere is perfect you have the flashy food truck parked inside with plenty of tables to stand at to enjoy your meal. While eating you can look around and see the signatures of all the previous guests from around the globe who have signed the walls, be sure to locate the manager and ask for the sharpie so you can join the club.\n\n Let's get down to the food, we had the brisket sandwich and let me tell you it's not the Kansas City style I was expecting, but let me say my mind was BLOWN!!  I was served a large, soft yet firm hoagie stuffed with tender brisket topped with delicious slaw finished with a mouth watering sweet yet spicy sauce that was drizzled over the meat and made its way to the bread but never made the sandwich soggy, probably because I shoved it in my face as fast as humanly possible because it tasted so good.\n\nYou can tell this wasn't made by some sloppy hillbilly standing in his back yard burning meat on a junkie old smoker. This was put together by the hands of a experienced chief who knows their way around a kitchen. I can tell you that most BBQ is really just plain meat that needs sauce to force it down. This in not that food. Everything on the sandwich flows together for perfect food harmony creating the ultimate orgasmic tastebud experience, sorry for the detail but i figured I should warn you in case you need to bring an extra pair of pants. You will not leave hungry and for me that's always a plus. If you want good food for a good price this is your spot!! And if your traveling from one of the BBQ Mecca's like Kansas City, Texas, Memphis or the Carolinas I would absolutely put this place on the map as a must visit."

It was super salty with zero smoke flavor.  The pieces of pork didn't have any smoke ring or bark.  It was as if they just cooked it in an oven.  It also came with the \"truck made\" slaw.  The slaw was ok but had cilantro in it.  The bread roll it came on was store bought.  The BBQ sauce was mainly just sweet with some garlic and onion notes.\n\nThe brisket sandwich was probably the weirdest thing.  When I order a brisket sandwich I expect slices of brisket, not cubes.  The brisket was tender but also had zero smoke flavor, smoke ring, or crust.  It was also skimpy on the meat.  6 cubes of brisket and one cube of nothing but fat on the entire sandwich.  It also came with the truck slaw and the store bought bread.  \n\nSo 2 sandwiches and a bottle of water cost us $25.  There is way better BBQ for cheaper elsewhere.  I suggest you go for the elsewhere.  Your tastebuds and wallet will thank you."

Its suppose to be fresh but it tastes watered down and reheated. I guess if you're drunk or partying you may not notice. The manager/owner Rex seems to be on drugs or something. He acts erractic and pours an unnatural amount if sweat. Like the amount of sweat drug addicts sweat. Which is disturbing considering he's dripping that in your food. It is the only place on Fremont street to get BBQ and they know it so don't expect any good customer service.  Although the cashier girl was sweet so that was cool."

And yes, I agree with another Yelper, there were no prices to be seen, but hey, you're in Vegas!  The sandwich was a decent size with some tasty pulled pork and bbq sauce.  I had two issues with it:\n\n-the juicy tender pork made the bread soggy\n-more bbq sauce needed\n\nIt would've been great if the pork was tossed with the sauce and perhaps it wouldn't soak the bread.  Other than those two issues, the pork and sauce were delicious!  Maybe next time, I'll make that request.  Solid place for a sandwich and free entertainment!"

                  "text": "I was driving by, noticed the name change from Dimas to Los Tapatios. \n I did a u-turn and thought I would give them a try. I quit Dimas around 3 or 4 years ago after a new owner change a year or two before that. When I started going there 8 yrs ago the food was consistently good. They were the California style Mexican food like Robertos that I enjoy. After new owners came in I would eat there every now and again because it was closer than Robertos, (before the new one) but it wasn't always good. Hit and miss. \n  When I saw the new sign I hoped to find a new good Mexican food place. I looked at the menu a good long time and noticed it looked like the same menu but with higher price changes taped over the old. Probably because Robertos prices went up so they thought they could raise their prices also.  I ordered the plate with hard shell beef taco and enchilada with rice and beans.  When ordering I told the woman I'll take a number 10(?) (or whatever the number was) with a cheese enchilada. She was looking at her handwritten cheat sheet to see what a number 10 plate was and I helped her by saying beef taco and cheese enchilada. She then asked hard shell? and I answered yes.  I used my card to pay and wrote $1 on the tip line. She was ringing it into the card machine as I was writing and she literally asked me \"Did you want to put a tip on it?\" I hadn't handed her the reciept yet but I had written the small tip on there, but I couldn't believe she asked. She was an owner. In my day owners never expect tips in business, let alone ask if you want to leave a tip. I normally tip 20% or more in restaurants with food servers, but this is a order at the counter and go get it when it's ready type of place.\n I got the food and first thing I noticed is the taco shell was not like most places. It didnt look to be a corn tortilla fried hard. It looked like a premade shell put into the deep fryer to make it appear to be a fresh fried hard shell. It was smaller. The 'beef' was seasoned ground beef and too greasy and salty. Meat is always shredded beef when menu says beef hard shell taco, so I didnt know it wouldn't be. I've never even seen ground beef on the menu of these types of Mexican restaurants. It was like a taco bell small taco. Then I cut into my cheese enchilada to find it was also the greasy ground beef!  Who makes ground beef enchiladas besides at home American style? Even I don't.  Every place I have ever ordered enchiladas, the choices is always cheese, chicken or beef, which is shredded chicken or beef. Beans were good, rice was ok but I'm used to Mexican rice with tomatoes blended in the sauce which give it the orange color. This was white (kind of grey)and mushy. It did have a decent seasoning flavor but not what I like. My rice is better. I only ate two bites of each the taco and the enchilada, most of the beans, and some of the rice, all the while comtemplating whether or not to tell her this was not what I asked for or expected. I decided to tell her and brought my food up to the counter. Waited for them to notice me for about 10 seconds then just said forget it, and left my food right there and left. \n \n If their prices were lower than Robertos or Gerardos, which are closer to me, I would try them again. Especially since they have a sign saying fish tacos .99 on Wednesdays. But I don't want to gamble when I know I can get good food somewhere else for the same price."

I tend to order it everytime even when I intend  to order a new dish. Their shredded chicken is juicy, fresh and incredibly spiced. \n\nJust today I ordered the Carnitas plate. It came with this huge, thick and awesome flour tortilla. The Carnitas almost melted in my mouth and I think I ascended to my ancestors where I was welcomed with open arms. It was so perfect and no other place comes close to the quality. I definitely recommend it. \n\nFeeling cheap? Dollar tacos on Tuesdays and Monday's. These aren't some Taco Bell bullshit tacos. These are real, juicy and perfectly fried tacos. They use this thick corn tortilla and add a bunch of grilled chicken or beef. My wife's even loves this place and she's the pickiest eater in the world.\n\nEdit: One thing I forgot to mention is they have HOT chile. So many Mexican places have this tomatoe soup for chile and it sucks. Habaneros has habanero chile! It tastes amazing as well and being genuinely hot."

Tons of options and the last time my girlfriend and I went in, we found out they have a vegan burrito for a super awesome price. We tried it out and got it enchilada style and oh my goodness it was the size of my arm and so flavorful. Their salsas are incredible as well. Housemade pico de gallo, super fresh verde sauce, a smoky spicy red and a habanero sauce that's sure to get you reaching for more. We will definitely be back! Thank you habaneros \n\n\n\nEDIT: Found out they use animal lard in their beans, which means the vegan burrito is not vegan. Pretty disappointing"

The atmosphere was busy but not frantic.  The decor was fun and playful, making you feel very comfortable.\n\nThe guacamole was outstanding (we ate the entire thing) along with their tortilla soup and salsa verde.  The shrimp enchiladas were enjoyed on my second visit, those too were phenomenal.  Their food has a balance of spice and flavor without being overly salty.  Their tequila selection is killer.  If you enjoy good tequila this is your spot, they have just about everything you want and a few you may not have heard of yet.  \n\nYou have to be sure to get a picture on the swing next to the bar.  It's a fun photo op and a great way to remember the place.  La Comida makes a great first date spot, especially if you want to see how your date holds their alcohol.  It's also fun with a group of people, their bench seating easily accommodates large parties.\n\nIf you like Mexican food, a relaxed environment, and great tequila - I dare you to try this place.  You won't be sorry!"

Love the ambiance and decor but the food is simply meh.  Think Chevy's meets Vanguard Lounge...except I can at least think of a couple dishes at Chevy's I like.\n\nI came here with several friends and one asked the server for nachos. The entertainment went as follows:\nHer: Can I please have nachos?\nServer: We don't have nachos\nHer: Do you have chicken, tortilla chips, salsa, cheese, beans, guacamole, and sour cream.\nServer: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, and yes.\nHer: Then you have nachos.\nServer: Sorry we do not serve nachos, this restaurant is authentic mexican.\nHer: [pout face]\n\nShe then proceeded to order each individual item as a side and dumped them on her plate and made...yup nachos. So yeeeahhh, if it's not considered \"authentic\" I get if it's not on the menu but if you have the ingredients what's so hard about accommodating a guests request? She didn't ask someone to go slice up some beef stomach and make menudo. I guarantee it took more energy to individually prepare and serve those items, then to just dump them on a pile of chips. I don't get it, anyway, rant over. \n\nThe food is subpar and considering that there are multiple \"authentic\" Mexican restaurants within a two mile radius, this place would only be good for a quick drink."

A friend recommended La Comida before we even left San Diego.\nI asked the wife if she would like to try the restaurant, and off we went. That was the best damn food choice we made, we went back two more times before we came back to SD. Jonny was our bartender, very friendly and attentive to our drink needs. Every drink we ordered was made and mixed to perfection, I was impressed, and that is not easily done since I am in the food and drink industry.\n Now about the food, first time we ordered we played it safe, (we are a long way from home if you know what I mean) we had the carne asada salad and the carnitas tacos, lets just say \"WOW!!!\" the flavors were amazing and worked very well together' the meats were tender and moist and every bite was better then the last. about that time the manager (Rafael) came over to check on us, I said everything was awesome. he asked what we had and then suggested next time be more adventurous, and asked if next time we come in if he could order for us. I told him tomorrow he would have that opportunity. the next evening we were back, greeted by a very friendly hostess and Rafael, who asked if we like pork and chicken. We were seated in about 30 sec. drink orders taken, chips and salsa on the table. don't get me started on the chips... (3 bowls).  soon after that our food arrived, WTF??? I never got a menu, Rafael said he ordered for us. we had the Puerco Ahumado and Chicken Al Horno. This was truly Mexican food at it's best. I could not believe the flavors that these dishes had. Everything was above excellent, all the staff awesome, the chefs are amazing and talented. Thank you La Comida for being part of our awesome vacation. We will be back again and again."

And the freshest margaritas with the most intense flavors you're sure to taste in this town, and food. It has glorious food. \n\nStopped in on my way to somewhere else, was actually taking advantage of the valet parking that is oh so convenient, when I decided to stop in here to not seem like a cheater (valet requires you to eat here). I'm glad I'm honest. \n\nSat down and was greeted by a pretty girl in a cute outfit who really knows her way around a bar. Inquired about all the tasty margaritas and she explained which was tart, which was sweet, mellow, etc. Super helpful stuff there. Also threw some chips and salsa in front of me that alerted the tasted buds that delicious stuff was on the way. Thanks for the heads up, sexy, salty chips!\n\nI ended up with two different margaritas. The first was a passion fruit margarita, which was fine, don't get me wrong, but it was nothing like the next one I had. Whew. Was talking to Michelle, I think that was her name, and she recommended I try the verano de jalisco. I am a huge fan of cilantro and added to this drink it made it fresh and delicious. The unusual salt (can't remember the name) around the rim just made it all the better. Do these!\n\nI then had a side of elotes asados and it was sooooo freaking good. The plate was piled so high I couldn't eat it all. I should have eaten it all because now I want some and I realized how much I wasted. Regret.\n\nBut, the great news is, I can go and get some more anytime I want!\n\nSo, that's all I had there, but just what I had left me drooling for more.

Got seated immediately and lucking it was one of the places that was still open to under 21 guests, which FYI is hard to find downtown after 9pm.\n\nWhat I liked:\nThe mason jar cups, patterned wallpaper, and hipster servers really gave it that downtown feel with a cool modern Hispanic flavor. Our server was pretty great as well, and I really enjoyed the energy and fun all of the server shared with one another.\n\nWhat I ordered:\nThe Ceviche de Camaron - Worst ceviche I've ever had... It was caked with some kind of cilantro sauce. Also the shrimp was very small, something you'd find in a cheap buffet. But the plantain chips were a nice spin, it was the first time I had them with ceviche.\n\nMexican Burger - *Beware* if your server recommends the Mexican burger don't get it. Three of us ordered it and none of us finished it... came out very rare. Wish my server asked me how I wanted it cooked. The sweet potato fries were very mushy and got cold quick as well.\n\nThey gave us unlimited family style rice and beans for FREE with our entrees which was great, but they taste pretty average. Don't be impressed, but heck at least they were free!\n\nThe service:\nServer was terrific and very knowledgeable of the menu and it's offerings. All of their servers seemed like hipsters and did a great job taking care of one another's tables.\n\nOverall, I was not very impressed by this place and I can see why they have a 3 1/2 star rating on yelp. \n\nImho, La Comida was an exceptional experience for it's atmosphere but the food quality and taste really disappointed. I would highly recommend this place for the atmosphere and vibe, the food not so much. If you're feeling mediocre Mexican food and want to experience the new downtown feel give it a shot. \n\nAtmosphere 5/5\nService 3/5\nFood 2/5"

The carnitas tacos were dry and underwhelming, and did not come in the pulled pork form that I am accustomed to eating.

I met up with my family here after dinner as they had suggested La Comida for a few drinks before heading out into downtown. I bellied up to the bar and took a look at the margarita menu. I'm not a huge tequila fan so I asked the bartender what her favorite drink was on the menu? \"El Corral\", she replied. Well saddle up partner...let's do this. \n\nThe \"El Corral\"  margarita comes with Anejo Tequila, sour mix & Grand Marnier. The drink was refreshing at first and not over powering with the tequila, however, with every sip the drink got sweeter and sweeter. I actually didn't even finish the whole drink, I passed the rest to my GF and ordered a whiskey based margarita. Mmmm, this was super tasty and very interesting. A little Jameson, soda water and a splash of sweet & sour mix. Not on the menu, but if you sweet talk Tanya she might make one for ya. I did try my cousin's drink, the Tamarind margarita, and I liked this one a little bit than my original drink. More salty than sweet.  I'll get you next Tamarind...next time. Muahahahah\n\nI did eat chips and salsa while I was here and I looovvveee me some chips and salsa. The offerings at La Comida are above and beyond. I ordered the Roma Tomato and Habanero salsa which definitely had a kick, but nothing too strong for the palate. I loved this and could have possibly eaten the whole bowl by myself. \n\nMy time in La Comida was brief, but delightful.

I appreciate the cleanliness, the environment and I have always had a good experience with the staff. \n\nTo be perfectly honest, the last time we went, we chose La Comida because our first choice for dinner had too long of a wait time. You can look at it as though we settled or you can look at it as us choosing it because we knew it was a safe bet that it would be a solid meal.\n\nOur waiter was hilarious and engaging and the food was very timely. I chose the breaded shrimp tacos (Camaron Al Maya) and didn't regret it. I'm a wuss when it comes to spice, so the jalapeno cream was just the right amount of \"kick\" - any more and it would have been too much (for me). Their appetizer, queso fundido is a group favorite of ours, alongside the guacamole and the street corn. \n\nOverall a solid experience and a safe bet when choosing a place to eat."

Very good & warm.

My husband had the queso, which he said was just okay.  Our friends ordered an enchilada (with fantastic reviews), two people ordered the pork shoulder (with fantastic reviews).  \nUnfortunately, it sounds like the restaurant got off on the wrong foot; however, I would say that this is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants!"

It is usually hit or miss on the crowd. I have been there multiple times, but I have never had to wait more than 15 min.\n\nFood - The menu is short and sweet. They have lots of Mexican favorites. My favorite are the street tacos. The chicken and steak are perfectly seasoned and grilled to perfection. The tortillas are fluffy, and the guacamole is fresh. They also bring out a large plate of rice and beans to share family style for the table. \n\nDrinks - They have the most fun and exotic margarita flavors. I have a strong liking for the paseo fruit and guava flavors. They are the perfect blend of fruit and tequila, and the tequila is hidden. They will hit you after 2-3."

Everyone was really friendly and the service was excellent, but I wasn't impressed with the food at all. I ordered the Red Snapper for $22 and it over cooked on the outside and covered in salt and pepper. One of my friends said it best: \"if you think it's salty, it must have been really salty\". I eventually scraped all the salt and pepper off the fish and managed to choke it down with help from my iced tea. I thought the Cheese Fundido was a bit flavorless so I asked my friends what they thought about the meal before I wrote this review. It sounds like I'm not the only one in the group that didn't think the food was note worthy so I decided to write an honest review. The chips and salsa were \"meh\" and the Guacamole dip was even more \"meh\".  \n\nI don't feel the food is worthy of what they charge so I think you should leave it for the tourist and hit Tacos El Gordo or Don Jaun."

I have, at this point, tried almost everything on the menu.. but tonight I went for the Enchiladas de Mariscos, which were tender and flavorful shrimps with queso fresco and sour cream rolled in two soft flour tortillas and drenched in a delicious tomatillo sauce. The sauce tasted like what my Grandmother's marinara would if she were from Mexico instead of Italy- I could eat that shit on white rice. It was like heaven, if heaven were a sauce. Long story short, it made the dish. The shrimps were super moist and tender, like they had been poached instead of grilled like most places do.

The inside is nice and very old school. Kinda like day of the dead. There is also a swing located by the bar. Which I didn't see anybody ride. LOL \n\nWe started our dinner with a passion fruit margarita, which was actually really yummy and I just had me a regular modelo beer.I ordered the ceviche which came with plantain chips, I thought it was kind of different. I preferred the ceviche with the tortilla chips that they served when you get there. I also thought it would be a big portion of ceviche but obviously with my picture it wasn't. But enough to get me full. My partner ordered the nachos, served with steak, cheese, guacamole, and jalapenos. They also served the nachos not with tortilla chips. Im not sure what kind of chips they were but they were thick. The nachos were OK. Wasn't a really big fan and the portion was OK as well. I know that when I go to a Mexican restaurant they always serve a big portion of their food. We ended our dinner with the tres leches cake which was really yummy and I guess you could say I would order that cake again.\n\nIm not sure if I would come back to this restaurant, but if I do I think I would have to be really drunk. \n\nOhh and their servers, they talk to each other too much. I shouldn't have to yell for them to fill both my cups of water and ask for more tortilla chips.Just sayin."

While there were some dishes that were spot on, we found others that needed a little more refinement.

I used to live in Central America when I was younger and remember loving the chicken here, specifically the citrus grilled chicken. \n\nI went for the first time last week to try it out and was so disappointed when they were out of the citrus grilled chicken at about 8:00pm in the evening. Went again just tonight with my family at 7:00pm and again they were saying they were completely out of the citrus grilled chicken again!!!  How do you run out of your signature item during the peak of dinner time for customers??? Seriously? This is the sign of a very poorly run establishment. I probably will not go back again. Pretty sad!"

I enjoy the plantains, campero beans, and yucca fries. Some of the sides are premium sides, which means they cost a little extra so be sure to watch out for that. Do not order the coleslaw. It has no flavor and is pretty terrible. \n\nWhen they first opened this location, they offered like 8 different sauces for the chicken, but now they only have a few. Campero sauce is my fav which is like a creamy thousand island. On my last visit I asked the cashier for campero sauce and she said they were out. But when another worker brought me my food I asked her for the same sauce, and she got me some. Why lie? Maybe the cashier didn't know they had more, but at least look before you say no. \n\nI usually get a 12 piece mixed family meal with 3 large sides for $28.99 plus tax. You get tortillas or dinner rolls with the meal too and it's more than enough food for 4 people so we always have leftovers. I will choose this place over the crazy chicken anytime! \n\nPro tip - When you order your meal, ask for half and half so you get to try both kinds of chicken!"

The chicken pieces were decent sized and full of flavor. I don't know what type of spices they use but the taste is fresh and citrus-y. \n\nOn our second visit we ordered an 8 piece combo that included mostly grilled with a couple of fried. We also had plantains and beans. The fried chicken was juicy but no where near as flavorful as the grilled. \n\nThe first two visits were dine in visits and every visit after has been to-go. \nFrom our visits we have determined we will only order grilled chicken and to only order it to-go.  There have also been a few issues with trying to place our order as there is sometimes a language barrier; however, someone usually appears quickly to recover the situation.\n\n\n\nEnjoy... the grilled chicken!"

We asked for half and half to taste both. Grilled had the most amazing citrus, herbaceous flavors. Soo good, you don't need any sauce! Fried chicken tasted like normal fried chicken. \n- Empanadas! We got the trio and all of them were delicious. Gooey cheese, meat, and their respective sauces. The empanada was warm and flakey. Doesn't get any better than this! \n\nCons:\n- Sides are meh. We got rice and street corn salad. The rice was bland. The street corn salad was very herby and had this green bean that tasted like a lima bean. There wasn't much corn. The flavors were good, but the texture wasn't to my liking. \n- Flan is meh. We got that for dessert because the picture looked amazing, but what we got was store bought flan. \n- Sauces.  We were so excited to try the pesto and creamy cilantro, but they didn't have it. They didn't have 4 out of the 6 sauces.. We tried Chipotle Honey Mustard and Campero sauce, but they tasted like regular honey mustard and thousand island dressing. So we ended up not using either since it took away from the taste of the chicken.\n\nEnd story: skip the sides and buy the grilled chicken only with a side of empanadas!"

They bring your order to the table in BEAUTIFUL porcelain plates & they also clean up after you. The employees have always been friendly with me & provide great customer service. I always leave a tip even though it is not a traditional practice with fast food place. Their drive through is pretty quick. The only reason why I don't rate them a 5 is because if you order food a little later in the evening it doesn't taste as fresh or juicy. Other than that it's a must TRY! Goodbye Pollo Loco & KFC."

I had the 3 price grilled meal with street corn salad , dinner roll and soda for $9.41 including tax .\nThe only item I didn't like was the dinner roll .  I chose this option over tortillas and I regretted it .\nNot only was the dinner roll not tasty but they don't have butter or honey to serve with it . Next time I will stick to the tortillas.\nEverything else was GREAT! The grilled chicken had a citrus lime flavor and tasted like it just came off the grill . This grilled chicken has a much better flavor than the other chicken places (you know who I'm talking about.)\nThe street corn salad is also a must have item . If you want another side -do yourself a favor and get an extra side of this corn salad in addition to the other side that you may think you want.\nI was also impressed that the food was served on a real plate instead of plastic or paper.\nThe restaurant seemed clean and the employees were happy but productive. \nI don't have this chain in my neighborhood, but I will gladly make the trip to this side of town to eat here again ."

Not only that, SEVERAL people ordered AFTER me and where given chicken within a couple of minutes. Also, the cook brought in at least 15 freshly cooked whole chickens from outside as I waited.. So once again, the NEW cashier attempts to make me take another type of meat. I refused once again and nicely asked for a refund. He walks away tallying to other workers as I wait to be reimbursed. Another 10 mins goes by as I wait for my damn money. By far the worst experience I've ever had there. \n\nThere was one instance where I ordered chicken (instead of asada) fries and the cashier handed me a half portion container. I order these fries at least twice a week and this guy swears they've always been this size. My buddy went 3 days ago and got the original larger portion with no issue. I was skeptical after that visit but gave them the benefit of the doubt. After today's visit I will no longer go back. Great food doesn't make up for s****y service. It's truly getting worse."

After placing our order I noticed that there were a bunch of half chickens stilling on the grill , kind wish i ordered that instead of the burrito.\nAte the tacos first, the meat was tender and it came with onion and cilantro on it, didn't need much more as it was gone in 3 bites as any street taco would be(good thing they are only a $1) \nThe burrito had pinto beans and rice,very mushy, reminded me of pork and beans out of a can, large in size as it came with a good amt of meat, however dry, so needless to say that it had to be eaten with the red sauce that came with. Over all it was a very clean new looking trailer, the food was what could be expected from a Mexican food truck!

Me, Elnino F, Andy T. and Elizar get tacos.\n\nDefinitely the crowd isn't the food truck culture crowd, it was straight up all Mexican. Good to me to see a crowd of people eating food from their culture. \n\nThe tacos were $1 so I got 2 lengua/tongue and 1 pastor/marinated pork and I got a $1 canned soda (crush or coke). Not bad for $1 tacos! My lengua was soft and flavorful. The pastor was good, but I tend to like when it goes more the savory route and this had a slightly sweeter marinate to it. \n\nI would say it's not for the people who are germ freaks because the salsas are just sitting outside in containers.

Still ostensibly a spot for locals but at the same time one more likely to generate tourist traffic given its locale it is obvious on entry that Naked City of Paradise is targeting a more family friendly vibe than the first and with clean lines, dark woods, and walls clad in old photos overlooking a fresh menu of specials serving to compliment the old favorites it was with some indecision that an order was cast; a half dozen items plus one on the house coursed out in four rounds by a young woman who outperformed the majority of her hospitality counterparts on The Strip.  Beginning with appetizers before moving to things more substantial it was with Sinatra playing just a bit too loudly that our first plates arrived and with the spicy dip teaming in buffalo sauce proving the superior of the pair along with housemade flatbread things would only improve from there, the second round featuring a pork packed spin on the Croque Madame beneath a blanket of garlic and cheese alongside fresh cut noodles served steaming hot to render its garnishing egg into a smooth, creamy sauce.  Having opted against the pie made famous by Diners, Dives, and Drive-Ins my first go-around but this time unable to resist it was in the $21 'not so wee' half sheet of the Guinea's pie that we indulged next and although the supple meatballs and ample ricotta proved a stellar pairing to the lightly blistered, toothsome crust it was with full bellies and big smiles that we finally gave up - a quarter pie carried home by a friend along with nearly a pound of tender bombolini that we fool heartedly ordered to finish only to be surprised by a complimentary order of the chocolate gilded and feather-light tiramisu, as well."

Man, oh man! Solo delicious! A wee is big enough to take three slices home! \n\nFinished it with Zeppolones, a fried dough dessert. Also screaming but way too many are included. \n\nI gave it 4 stars because they didn't have the football game on because they don't have cable. Really?!

The pizza and wings are really reminiscent of the pizza places I grew up with in the north town suburbs (Santoras, Picassos, Marvinos, Raymondos, etc).  \"Buffalo style\" pizza is unique and really hard to find outside of WNY.  I've lived all across the US and road tripped almost all 50 states and can't say that any other region has anything like it, but Naked City nails the crust, cheese and toppings (specifically, the little pepperoni that curl up when baked and act like delicious little oil cups).  I haven't tried much else beyond the pizza and mild/medium/hot wings & fingers (anything else isn't really a Buffalo Wing in my book), but I'll be back time and again just for that little taste of home."

I should have listened to the others, so I really have no one to blame but myself, but we had an entertainment coupon and it was on DDD, so how bad could it be, right???  The first red flag should have been the guy alone PASSED OUT in the booth. The server said he was waiting for his party to arrive and acted like it was totally normal for someone to be sleeping, with their mouth wide open in a restaurant. Red flag number 2, besides him, there was only one other family in the restaurant, on a Saturday night at 5:45pm. We ordered our food (1 wee,1 not so wee, 1 salad, and 1 sausage sandwich) and then we waited. Red flag number 3, after we placed our order we had to give our dirty, paper menus to the people next to us that had just say down. I guess they didn't have enough to give them? Weird!!! After waiting 45 minutes we were starting to get really hungry and the restaurant was filling up. We asked about how much longer and the sever said any minute, but that they only had two ovens and there were a lot of orders. She laughed about it like it was a joke and when I said this is not funny, we are starving she said \"it's my job to smile\" in her snarkiest voice. This is when I started to lose my patience. My 4 year old was starving, (and at this point had eaten all of the snacks I had in my bag) as were the rest of us. When we ordered our food, we were the only table in the restaurant that had no food! The people next to us were already eating and I am pretty sure the guy passed out was not planning on eating. So why then was it taking 45 minutes to get our food!?!?  Finally 15 minutes later our salad came out, but we had no plates. Then one pizza came out, but not the other. The two other tables that came in after us got their pizzas before we got our second pizza and our sandwich!!! So half my family had no food! The other half couldn't eat anyway because they use so much cheese it took forever to cool off enough to be able to eat it. The service was terrible and my husband had to get up four different times to get napkins, knives, extra plates, and a box. The tables are also ridiculous. Every time one of us had to get up we had to move the table to be able to fit. We are regular sized people, but the tables are like picnic tables at a booth and the wood legs block you in. I have never had to move an entire table to be able to get out of my seat. When we were finally done no surprise the bill was wrong. They had said they would take off the sandwich because they messed it up (shocker) but it was still on the bill. As we got in the car to leave we all breathed a sigh of relief that dinner was over. I guess all you can do is laugh about it and of course \"yelp\" about it. Thanks for reading!"

The seating is the worst I've experienced in a long time - super low tables. Every time I moved my legs I thought I was going to tip the table. It is no place for a full sized man.  I ordered wings and I asked for them to be hot, a slice of pepperoni pizza and a small beef, cheese and peppers sandwich. The wings were perfectly cooked with good crispy exterior but very under seasoned and under sauced too. I asked for hot and they were the mildest wings I've ever had plus very little sauce was on them. I noticed that the plate they were served on only had a few specks of sauce left on it when I'd finished the wings. The pizza was not at all for my taste. The crust was very bready and doughy, soft and limp. The sauce had a very nice bright tomato flavor but no other flavor - no taste of spice, herbs etc., one dimensional and bland. the cheese was abundant but rubbery and the pepperoni was warmed thru w/o any bit of char. It tasted like it needed more time in an oven or like it was microwaved. It was boring and bland. The sandwich came wrapped in paper which seemed weird for an order that wasn't to go.I had the sandwich last and I think the paper wrapping made the bun steam a bit. By the time I ate it, the bun was soft on the outside where it should have had some crusty texture. Was not appealing. The meat was grey, dry, featureless, unseasoned and the little bit of cheese seemed like an afterthought.  The sandwich as a whole tasted of peppers and little else, like the other two items, totally bland and boring. . I tried three items and all three were bland, boring, poorly executed. Think hospital food.  Also, very uncomfortable seating. Wont return."

We watched two guys make a 323 point turn trying to get in and then back out when they realized it wasn't going to happen.  There is plenty of space available in the back.\n\nAs a lover of all foods spicy, the suicide fries instantly stood out.  We decided to do a full order of them and then a quarter sheet Guinea Pie.  We got some drinks as well and waited for our order.\n\nThe fries came out first...they were spicy.  I absolutely love all spicy food, but the habanero suicide sauce was almost too much for me to handle.  It was amazing.  I was sweating in places on my face that I didn't know could sweat...like right under my temples...it was crazy.  It took a while, but I built up a decent enough tolerance and was able to enjoy around half of them.  They were way too much for my girlfriend to handle.  These were amazing, anyone who loves really spicy food must try them out.\n\nThe pizza was good too!  The meatballs were really tasty, the cheese all tasted great, and the white garlic sauce tied it all together really nicely.  The quarter sheet was the perfect size for two, and we could have easily fed a third between the fries and the quarter sheet...this was a welcome change from the awful prices and small portions we were used to on the strip.\n\nOverall it was a great meal.  Easily one of the best I've had in Las Vegas.  I'll be recommending this place to family and friends for a long time and look forward to coming back myself."

My comrades ravished it! \n\nThey also ordered the bucket of (50) Buffalo chicken wings in which they were able to only kill about half of before our two pizzas came. \n\nYou'd pass this place up if you weren't looking for it intentionally, it's quite small. \n\nOverall we had a really great dining experience. Our waitress was attentive, kind and put our experience over the top. \n\nIf I knew how to give .5 stars, I'd have given this 4.5!"

If on the strip, it's a strong consideration if you're a pizza fan or a DDD fan. Guy was here so check out the flavortownusa site as well. \n\nThe pie here is money. Besides the crust being thick and cooked well, the toppings are Top Notch. \n\nWe had 6 of us. We ordered 3 \"wee\" size pizzas and two orders of \"wee\" size fries. And almost finished everything. The pizza is very filling based on a thick doughy crust. \n\nOne girl running all the tables was very good. If it was really busy, service could be really slow. However we did not have any issues. Good craft beer selections. No mainstream beer. \n\nI loved it, enjoyed the unique options and nothing disappointed. Hope I win some money at the Black Jack table tonight."

The service we received upon entering was one of the worst I've ever experienced. We walked in and the female worker didn't seem like she even wanted to be here. She literally gave us the saltiest face while bossing another coworker around to take care of us. She was very rude and didn't even want to acknowledge us. I came in and the environment just put me in a bad mood immediately. After tasting the food as well, I don't think I'll ever be returning. \n\n\nI gave this a 3 star because the guy who served us stayed happy and was smiling at least. The boss/manager came by after we raised our concerns to the female worker like three times. He gave us a full refund for everything and even asked if we can come back. Because of the phenomenal customer service i received from the owner, I cannot give them a 1 star like originally planned. Im thankful that there are still owners out there that cares about their business and customers. Who knows? Maybe we will give this another shot."

You can add an egg to your burrito and I go for over medium. Whites cooked, yolks runny. The melted cheese option is amazing. \n\nI love this place but service is always slow. It's never quite busy enough to justify more staff but there isn't any rhyme or reason to how you order and then get rung up. It's still really confusing. \n\nWork in progress.

We split 3 carne asada tacos, a chicken quesadilla, and a ginormous steak burrito for $20. The gent who took our order was polite and everything came out in less than 10 minutes. We went back inside the bar to enjoy a drink while waiting for our meal to be freshly grilled.\n\nThere's a large variety of tacos to choose from for $2 each. Quesadillas are $6 and burritos are $7. Tacos for $2 are a little pricey IMO but the $7 burrito was huge and worth every penny. The $6 quesadilla was decent in size and absolutely delicious... The avocado made it complete. We agreed next time we'll just order 3 of those.\n\nGreat food truck with tasty Mexican bites. I've seen it outside Sand Dollar several times and am glad I finally tried it tonight!!"

The fish taco was the standout by a long shot.  2x the size of the others and a full fish with slaw and lemon juice and radish.  The short rib was tasty but seemed empty, as did the chicken.  The vegetarian was interesting, but it was more or less just cooked zucchini.  The tacos themselves, always corn, were superb.  Fresh yet stayed together, even after being drowned in some of the cool 4 types of salsa that comes complimentary.\n\nBruno's really is a great destination for food and hopefully they can expand.

A little more spice than the carnitas not greasy what so ever. I never had non greasy chorizo it was awesome, definitely ordering again. They do have a few draft beers, and other drinks like horchata. Next time I'll try the churros. Tacos were huge!  I could only eat 2"

You download their app and select what you like from their options. There are 100s of options. If you don't like any you can submit a photo of yourself too! \n\nWhen you walk in you can see that it is a VERY clean place. Not just because it's still pretty new of a few months, but you'll know what I mean when I walk in. There is about 6 tables and 2 family style table tops. So you could get about 40 people in this place comfortably. \n\nThe excitement to come here was pretty high. I had a friend that came in and told me about their bacon guacamole. This has bacon, not just on top, but INSIDE. Bacon in every bite! So then there were the options of all the tacos. They have 7 options and the option to go vegetarian. They bring you a flight of 4 hot sauces. \n\nChicken - SO tender\nCauliflower - it doesn't taste like it though, more like pineapple\nBaja fish - LOTS of cabbage, like waaaaaaaaay too much\nSteak - Very well marinated \nShort Rib - OMG! \nCarnitas - spot on\n\nI saw that they brought out green shelled tacos. No one told us about this as it was St. Patrick's day. Not only that, but we weren't offered ice cream to go on top of our churros. We were overwhelmed w/ all the goodness it would've been nice to have a little hand holding w/ these two things. \n\nThis place is right up the road from my house, so when I'm home I may just have a new taco spot to frequent."

I stumbled in here after one of our agents at our office told us about their soft opening after he had gotten them their lease for the building. Let's discuss the food shall we?\n\nThe Baja Fish Taco - by far my favorite! The fish is battered and fried to perfection! Upon subsequent trips here, I definitely expect to be ordering more of these in the future. The Carnitas, The Chicken Pastor, and the Grilled Skirt Steak Taco among some of the others that I also tried, great tacos!\n\nThere is also a number of drinks to try; we opted for the Jalopeno Lime Margarita, and the Passion Fruit Margarita. Both great choices! Although I might warn that the Jalopeno Margarita is a little on the spicy side. There are also a number of craft beers on tap to choose from. I decided to go with a pale ale from San Diego.\n\nI also noticed that as the night grew a little older, more people started to come in to check the place out and gave the place a really nice vibe. I anticipate that this will definitely be a successful business!"

It was little disappointing cause seen lot of photos on instagram and it looked like contender comes to taco shop around Vegas. I also consider fact that dam there so many taco shops around town. It kind of hard to distinguish yourself from the other spots. Bruno's does have it own style that stands out for me. It more about the interior design and the vibe of the place. It comes down to the tacos. Just ok. I would go back again since close to the house. \n\nThe food I started by ordering the guacamole with chips. I found the guacamole refreshing but lack of seasoning for me. It tasted like just straight avocado rather then having depth of flavor. The chips was nice crispy, hot, and were the perfect chips for dipping.!.! I got two different tacos one each. Chicken al pastor and grilled skirt steak. The chicken al pastor had nice hearty size of chicken in the taco. The pineapple salsa was little too much that never had nice balance between the chicken and the salsa. The grilled skirt steak taco looked like it was hurting. Only reason say that is not lot of slices of meat in it. When paired the two together and looking at it. Off. The skirt steak meat was ok. Like the chick al pastor lacked wow factor. The four different salsa they give you. Star by itself. I like the way it presented not out of bottle but classy. It goes from mild to hot. I tried little taste of each one. The hottest one is no joke. It packs punch. Just make sure try little before put whole bunch on. lol!!! \n\nThe interior design it like the fact got few different quality beers on draft and in bottles. They even have well that do fresh margaritas among other drinks like bloody mary. Taco shop that serves alcohol not many I have experience in Vegas. Plus. You can tell the place is brand new so everything got new new look to it. It nice and spacious with different seating options. The staff is by far five stars comes to service. It was my first time the guy took my order was friendly, attentive, and made great suggestions for me. \n\nThe prices are about average price per taco see other places similar. They bring the food to you once you order. \n\nOverall the tacos were ok. I still plan on going back cause the churros seen pics and the variety something worth another visit check out. If your going spend the same kind of money on tacos. Not one would recommend only because there so many other options."

I was only interested in a simple lunch; tacos and a soda.\n\nI ordered the steak taco, fish taco, and a pork taco. These tacos were really delicious; however, they are about $4/ each and only \u00e0 la carte. They also don't have fountain drinks, but instead, mexican coke. So after 3 tacos and a soda, my lunch was almost $18. One thing I did really enjoy is that they bring you out a flight of salsa. The salsas really help put the tacos over the edge. \n\nI would love to come back to try some of the guac, but coffee and tacos doesn't sound appetizing, and beer during a work day lunch isn't going to happen.

I randomly found out about them on IG (and yes I'm very disappointed that I didn't know about them or come across them sooner but they haven't been open for that long, so phew...), I grabbed my taco partner aka best friend and demanded we try them out. It didn't hurt that one of the pics on IG also showed they have mango chili margaritas (our favorite flavor and well TEQUILA!!). Not only is the place clean and cute but the menu is  a great mix of meaty and veggie tacos (also can be served on lettuce instead of tortillas for us carb watchers). I ordered a skirt steak, chicken and a short rib taco and each one was filled with their own distinct flavor and yummy goodness. Oh and I cannot forget the bacon guacamole served with perfectly salted chips! Crunchy bacon throughout the entire bowl of guacamole not just sprinkled on top which is a big thumbs up. Another nice touch is a \"flight\" of salsas that they bring to the table, each so flavorful and fresh from mild-medium-hot for all of your tastebuds to rejoice. With my tummy happy and in a taco/chip coma we realized we had to make room for a fruity pebbles churro with vanilla ice cream, I mean how can you not!

They are all so nice and polite and just a breath of fresh air for something that's a little more fast paced.\n\nSecondly the ambience is equally as amazing. Nice and clean, very modern little taco shop. It has a less authentic taco place kind of feel for it, but the flavor of the tacos and how well they season it definitely makes up for it. \n\nSo now the tacos. The tacos make me excited just writing this review! I had the fish taco and their taco of the week, which was sriracha shrimp, and my boyfriend had their short rib taco and grilled skirt steak and we shared a portobello taco. I am on some sort of flexidiet where I eat primarily pescatarian but I will have bites here and there of meat. And trying my boyfriends tacos made me want to devour the whole thing! (A very rare rare desire) the tenderness of both meats were unreal. The short rib was a little too salty for my tasting, but that did not make it any less delicious. The skirt steak was cooked at just the right temperature, flavored with just the right seasonings. Now my tacos. Lol. A tad less excited for, but they did an amazing job having vegetarian options available as well as fish. Their fish taco has an enormous beer battered fish on it! I had to put some of their salsa on it (WHICH BY THE WAY, ARE ALL SO SO SO GOOD) The sriracha shrimp one was the better one out of the two. It was battered as well, perfectly crispy and saucy and just amazing. And lastly, the least exciting of them all - the mushroom taco. I had tried a mushroom taco elsewhere and fell in love it, this one not so much. It is the vegetarian option for the skirt steak, but I loved everything about the skirt steak and not too much about the mushroom one. I felt like it needed more mushrooms or sauce bc I tasted a lot more of the tortilla than anything else. \n\nSo there ya have it! Definitely make this one of your taco Tuesday spots to try out!! So good!!"

YASSS! Apparently the playlist changes depending on who's working and they decide what plays on Pandora, but PLEASE KEEP THE 90s R&B! We love it! \n\nThe food portions are kind of big, definitely worth it. We were also given some sauces to try with our tacos. There's also a few items on their secret menu, check their Instagram to see what it is or check out my photos to see what I ordered!! And also be sure to ask what their taco of the week is!

But they actually bring the food and drinks out to where you are sitting which I thought was a step up above the rest. Somewhere in between a restaurant and a Chipotle. \n\nThe food: I tried the chorizo/potato taco and the vegetarian friendly zucchini ribbon taco. The chorizo taco was full of flavor on a corn tortilla. It ad delicious flavor but could have used a bit more potato. The drizzled sauce was delicious. The zucchini taco had great flavor for a veggie taco but the water content in the zucchini made it a little soggy. \n\nThe lady who brought our food out gave us a sample of four different salsas which went from a tomatillo salsa to a chipotle passionfruit. They were delicious.\n\nThe final note on Bruno's is the beer selection. They have an impressive selection of craft beers which I thought really took it to another level. Tacos and beer, couldn't ask for anything more! I will come back with a friend."

I've brought my nephew and sister on a few of these occasions as they are big fans of Bruno's.  I usually get the Chicken taco.  Everything is high quality and fresh.  We also get the guacamole and chips -- also tasty and fresh.  They give you four different salsas with each order.  Again, fresh and flavorful  I give a solid 5 stars based on the food.  I do have one complaint:  Those salsas. They come in a tray with four small dishes of salsa.  When I go to Bruno's on my own and order two tacos, I get that four-salsa tray.  When I go with my sister and nephew and his friend and we order 12 tacos between the four of us, they bring only that one tray.  So, no matter the quantity of food you order, you get this one small tray of salsas.  They should know better.  We have to keep asking for extra sauce -- shouldn't have to do that.  The other complaint is that they only have Coke Zero -- they don't have diet coke."

We had random workers stop by to ask how things were and to bring out our food. They weren't very organized and every interaction was kind of awkward.\n\nAlthough the service was not great, I believe that it could be fixed if the staff would have interacted with each other a little more and had a game plan for the few customers in the restaurant.

The carne asada was savory with a distinct sweet flavor from the pickled onions, the al pastor was similar in taste a savory with a hint of sweet from the pineapple . The beans and rice are similarly run of the mill nothing really stands out, the tamale I was very excited about but was disappointed unfortunately because the masa was very dry and there was little to no cheese or jalape\u00f1o, the red suace overwhelmed the flavor of the tamale itself. \nMy friend ordered the same plate but ordered the \"of the cob Mexican street corn\" aka an elote.

It is denser than the run of the mill market tees leches and you can see the hints of vanilla bean in the batter within the cake! They topped this with house-made whipped cream which was subtle sweet touch  and strawberries just perfect."

Because we all know that we love a good guac thrown in the mix of salsa. Chips & salsa re-mix!!!! In all honesty, it's the green salsa that really out shined the guac. If you're a fan of extra citrus and lots and lots of cilantro. Go green!\n\nOCTOPUS TACO: It came with rice and beans + a side, and the got the \"elote\" type corn. It was soft, tender, and packed with flavor. Of course, if you love that gamey, seafood flavor of an octopus, you'll like this. None of the fixings overpowered the octopus, because the octopus runs the show in this taco. I definitely recommend this if you're looking to be a little adventurous--steering away from the usual al pastors and carne asadas. \n\nBANDITO HOUSE MICHELADA: Idk if they make their own chili powder for it, but that tajin is LIT! It is a lot spicier. They put two pieces of fried pork short ribs (chicharron style). Take a bite of that chicharron. Then, take a big sip of the Michelada with the Tajin spice and just wait until you feel your taste buds throw a fiesta in your mouth. You're welcome. \n\nVENUE: It's definitely a good venue take your vendors, clients, or any business lunch/dinner for that matter. It's a great place to have a nice bougie dinner before the turn up with a big party. Date night? You betcha! it's cute, hip, and upscale for sure. The mural is also calls for a good photo opp or a 'gram. \n\nSERVICE: Service was pretty slow during lunch, but we weren't in much of a rush and it wasn't very busy there either. However, the staff was super attentive with five different people checking in on us-- also with quite the sense of humor. So props to them. \n\nDefinitely worth a try and worth bookmarking for all you hip, out-of-town, foodies."

Yes, it's small, but I absolutely love the decor and vibe of the place. It was an early Tuesday afternoon (of this week) and we sat at the bar. Unfortunately, I saw no name tag, but our receipt said 'Nicole' was who served us; an African American young lady who was an absolute pleasure. Can't wait to bring my fiance here. The chips were warm and fresh, guac was fresh and served with heirloom tomatoes on top, and both salsas (red and green) were amazing. I cannot WAIT to come back and try more than chips and salsa. As a fellow bartender, I was thoroughly impressed by the drink selection, and the fact they actually have 'mixologists' creating and constructing the drinks. Everything is made fresh.

A quick glance at the menu items and you immediately know that this is not authentic Mexican but rather a sad attempt at being original and cutting edge but falling miserably short. The drinks were watered down and punchless, the mojito tasted like rancid dishwasher. I mean, come on: \"sparkling wine\" in a mojito? How about fresh mint muddled with premium limes and topped with good quality syrup and soda instead? Barbacoa broth and soggy, deep fried pork rinds (sadly called chicharrones) in a michelada? Who comes up with this stuff? So we tried draft beer. Can't go wrong with that right? Wrong! Negra Modelo was flat and smelled of dish soap. The keg was either way old, the lines dirty, or the CO2 pressure needed some tinkering. Food wasn't much better. Fish tacos were dry and tasteless. Al Pastor was way over salted and greasy. Tortillas were rubbery and cold. Tortilla chips were thick and tasted greasy, almost waxy - probably due to being fried in the lowest quality, lowest cost fats. Frijoles charros were so salty I felt my blood pressure rising with every bite. Overall, the food simply did not taste fresh and vibrant. It had that cut-rate, cooked in the cheapest vegetable oil by poorly trained, uninspired staff kind of feel and texture. I wish I could say something positive but this kind of slop should not be allowed in the food scene in Vegas. Charging people good money for this is borderline criminal. We have way too many outstanding food options in this town to tolerate this kind of stuff."

The nachos are served as a giant mountain and worth the upcharge to add protein- the asada was nicely soft but I also liked how juicy the carnitas was without sacrificing crispiness! The quesadillas were also a hit at our table, and the ceviche impressed in that what we initially thought were pieces of giant Peruvian corn were actually scallops. I will do some shady shit for nacho cheese, and I was disappointed to find that the queso fundido was thin and lacked flavor. I'm not much of a drinker but I appreciated that the $5 margs were a full glass rather than the smaller pours I've seen elsewhere.

The Tamale Trio was our shared starter and that was delicious. The complimentary chips were good. We loved both the red and green salsa that were served with the chips.\n\nI went with Carnitas Tacos as my entr\u00e9e and loved the flavors on the tacos. The orange glaze on the meat added a great flavor. The beans and rice on the side were tasty. For my third side I chose Mexican Street Corn and enjoyed that as well. The tacos were loaded with meat, but sides were on the smaller side. I loved the overall portion of the meal and thought it helped me avoid going overboard. My husband had the Turkey Chorizo Torta and loved it.\n\nWhen dessert time came around we were told that the only dessert was a brownie. My husband is weird and doesn't eat chocolate in the form of brownie or cake so we had to pass. The waitress returned soon after with an amazing cheesecake made with serrano peppers and topped with a strawberry watermelon salsa. There was a nice caramel drizzle on the plate. It's a dessert that the restaurant is testing to possibly add to the menu. I thought it was so nice of them to bring this out since I love my desserts and was sad to have to decline the brownie option. The cheesecake was amazing too! I really hope to see this become part of the regular dessert menu. The cheesecake had an excellent flavor and the peppers inside added a nice heat that wasn't overwhelming. The fruity salsa really balanced the heat and the caramel was delicious.\n\nOur waitress was attentive and everything we ordered was delivered to the table without a long wait. The manager, I believe his name was Julian, checked in on us several times. He wanted to make sure that everything was great with both food and service.

I generally prefer a little chunky guac but it was still very tasty and had grape tomato halves in it. \n\nOn top, I had the salsa rojo which is supposed to have a little kick but did not have much of one in my opinion. I generally like spicy but what it lacked in kick it carried in flavor. \n\nThe service was great. I realize that where new places often struggle is with their service. This was not the case at Bandito's. Our server was great, the other staff regularly filled my water. The manager came over to ask us how we were doing and then even removed some finished plates from the table. \n\nThe place is very nicely decorated. They have a beautiful mural on the wall!

I think it's way overpriced for cheap beans that you can buy at a grocery store and make yourself. The beans here are probably canned they do not have any good taste to them. The burrito here is about $8 dollars I rather spend that money at chipotle it's cheaper over there. The customer service isn't well either the workers do not say hi when coming in the restaurant or say bye to you. I hate to say this but I don't see myself or my family coming here again.

I entered the place and there was about 30 people eating or waiting for their orders.  You order at the counter and you are given a \"beeper\" that alerts you to when your order is ready.  I ordered a beef burrito with a side order of refried beans.  I explicitly said I was hungry for refried beans and would like a large serving.  I also ordered a drink.  My total was $9.00 and change.  I filled my Styrofoam cup from the drink station and picked up my plastic knife and fork.  I was alerted that my order was ready in a reasonable amount of time and when I went to pick up my order, there was a lone burrito in a plastic basket lined with a thin paper and aluminum foil.  I asked where was my refried beans and they said they put them in my burrito.  I explained that wasn't how I ordered it but I would go ahead and accept it the way they fixed it.  My burrito was 90% beans with very little beef and a little sour cr\u00e8me and chopped tomato and onion.  Eating a burrito from a  plastic basket with plastic utensils on a sheet of foil is one of my least favorite ways to eat.  There were two squirt bottles on the table, one with red and the other with green sauce.  I try and give new places the benefit of doubt as I want them to succeed and I struggle with giving negative reviews, but it is what it is.  It's not the places fault but there were 3 different tables where children around the age of 4 or 5 would scream as loud as they could to either get attention or show their displeasure and the parents did little to teach them that behavior was not acceptable in a public place.  I was glad to get out of there quickly as parents not controlling their screaming children is at the top of my least favorite things.  I think that after getting my order wrong, that the  burrito was way over priced,  and serving food in a foil lined basket with plastic utensils, is what I have to say about Frijoles and Frescas."

Much like a great pizza is enhanced by the crust, a great fried avocado is enhanced by the batter. You can tell that Garden Grill LV pays attention to detail. The batter was excellent in taste and crunch, and the two sauces worked very well together. The jackfruit asada was a little spicy and sour... Just the way I like it. The breakfast burrito was also great. The sausage they use is a little salty, but it's fairly well balanced as a whole... Especially with so much spinach. I guess if I had to change one thing it would be to cut the sausage bits smaller and use less. Finally, the horchata was incredible. Best vegan horchata I've ever had. Not too sweet... Just grainy enough. Perfection with the meal."

I love the Jackfruit tacos and cannot wait to try more of their products. Everything is flavorful. The only thing I sort of dislike is that the tacos are $3.50 each and don't quite match up to the size of what you should get. But, i'm not complaining that much because there aren't too many places out here that sell 100% plant-based food. Fantastic food that can fool any carnivore into thinking it's real meat. Fantastic raw desserts as well. I highly recommend!"

I looked on the map and the original place we wanted to try was in the opposite direction of the dam.  So we decided to scratch that plan and see what was up with the Las Vegas Farmer's Market.  I searched for Farmer's Markets on Yelp and found Fresh52 located on Sundays at Sansone Park Place which was in the direction of the Hoover Dam. It was the perfect pit stop to the dam!\n\nAs we were walking through the Farmer's Market we found Garden Grill - an all vegan food stand specializing in tacos!  I was a happy girl as I stared at their mouthwatering display of tacos with creative fillings such as  - beer battered avocado, BBQ pulled jackfruit, chick'n teriyaki, asada jackfruit, breakfast, and plant-based steak.  Everything looked so delicious!  Not only did they have tacos, but they were also serving up philly cheeze steak sandwiches and specials like chick'n and waffles.  \n\nMy BF and I ordered two tacos each (2 beer battered avocado, BBQ jackfruit, and breakfast) and split the chick'n and waffles.  We were both in heaven as we ate our tacos - they were all so good!  I was happy that our chick'n and waffles also came WITH mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy; I don't see that too often with my experience with vegan chick'n and waffles in the Bay.  The chick'n was perfectly crunchy, waffle was perfectly crispy and mash and gravy was savory and delicious.  We were fighting for the last bite of waffle.  LOL.\n\nWe absolutely loved Garden Grill and hope they will expand and come to the Bay Area.  I also appreciated that their menu said \"Compassionate Food Crafters\" and \"Vegan for Life\".  Thank you Garden Grill for making the world a better place!"

And man, this place is very good.  Plant-based ingredients, terrific dishes, and surprisingly large portions.  The meal had a hangover cure feel to it as the sandwiches were full of heavy ingredients and sauce and bread, but still terrific.  The California Burrito ($12) was the size of a large Chipotle, full of beans, pico de gallo, guacamole, plant-based steak, cheese, and french fries.  I could have done without the french fries and cheese but the rest of the ingredients were fresh and delicious.  The hot sauce was awesome as well; don't forget to get extra.  The buffalo chicken sandwich ($10) had  a little too much sauce, but the meat itself was so flavorful that I'll give the sauce overload a pass. Add the great coleslaw on the sandwich and we have a winner. \n\nThe prices are of a sit down brunch spot overall but the portions are big and service was great and quick. The bread greatly underperformed in my opinion on the sandwich as well as the tortilla for the burrito, which is the main reason I'm knocking Garden Grill down from a 5 star experience.  I do really like that they park specifically at Farmer's Market which show the spot's freshness.  I would come here often if they opened a storefront.  Here's to hoping."

Im not a vegan but I still love it when a restaurant can take something so familiar like tacos and make it completly vegan and still have that same comfort food experience. Plus where else would I be able to try Jackfruit? So far I havn't seen it on any other menus around town. \nThere tacos are usually 2 for $7 so on my last visit I ordered the bbq jackfruit and the beet battered avocado tacos. Both were very tasty. I loved that the avocado taco came with a very beautiful and generous slice of a nice ripe and creamy quality avocado. And I'm not sure if they make there own tortillas or not but they are soft and delicious!\nthe only critiscm I can offer is that they sauces or salsa's could be a little spicier in my opnion.

It may seem pricey, but it's a filler upper fasho. I'm also a fan of the vegan Philly cheesesteak. The bread is so yummy too! It comes with this yummy sauce on top and every bite is so juicy and flavorful. I was a huge fan of the beer battered mushrooms, so I hope these come back!

Because we were gonna be in town, I entered to win tickets to the Life Is Beautiful music festival. Then I won two 3-day VIP passes thanks to Yelp LA West CM Brittany F.! Immediately did my research and discovered that Garden Grill was going to be serving up some vegan goodies at the festival.\n\nSh*t just got real!\n\nAt this point, I didn't even care about the bands anymore (except for Fitz and the Tantrums). All I could think about was BBQ Pulled Jackfruit Tacos and Beer Battered Avocado Tacos.\n\nThe line was surprisingly long. I didn't realize vegan food would be so popular at a music festival. But I guess that's a good thing. Each taco was offered at two for $8 but sadly they wouldn't let you mix and match that day. Later on I discovered that there's a Yelp check-in offer for $1 off your first order that I wish I knew about before hand. I also noticed that the taco prices listed on their website is $1 less than what they offered it for at the festival. Damn those festival prices!\n\nGreat BBQ flavor in the Jackfruit Tacos and I liked the crunchy mix of shredded cabbage in there. The creamy dill sauce on top was tasty too. http://bit.ly/1E7np5J\n\nThe portion was much smaller than I would have liked it to be for $8. Let's just say, on the drive back to LA, I stopped by a vegan market/cafe (Viva La Vegan in Rancho Cucamonga) and their jackfruit tacos were a much bigger and filling size at $3 a taco.\n\nI was still hungry after eating Garden Grill's jackfruit tacos so I ended up ordering the Beer Battered Avocado Tacos in which the serving size was significantly bigger. Large chunks of avocado batter fried in a way that doesn't make the avocado taste cooked (which I prefer). More crunchy shredded cabbage and a delicious creamy cilantro pepita dressing and Sriracha. It's very messy to eat but yum yum yum yum YUM! http://bit.ly/1yKXca0\n\nThe meateater BF was curious about the menu too so he ordered a Chick'n Ceasar Salad Wrap with grilled chick'n, ceasar dressing, croutons and romaine lettuce wrapped in a yummy spinach tortilla. I thought it was tasty! The meateater BF said he liked it better than the meaty prime beef sandwich from T-bones Chophouse a few tents down from Garden Grill. Yay for hooking the meateater! http://bit.ly/10DEeac\n\nYeah it's kinda pricey but the sad truth is, I would pay that much for their deliciousness. They get 5-stars from me! I just wish I had room for the Raw Chocolate Cheezecake while we were there."

I felt really adventurous that day, but honestly I like the regular chicken sandwich a lot more.\n\nBBQ pulled jackfruit tacos: very tangy, not my favorite since it was too BBQ-ey, but still very tasty.\n\nBeer-battered mushrooms with a side of aioli sauce: my favorite side dish!

That California burrito could change the mind of even the biggest skeptic. For me, the convenience of enjoying their creative and delicious menu at the farmers market while my daughter runs around on the playground can't be beat, but I'd love to see this hardworking team open their own restaurant!\n\nThey make some of the most flavorful vegan food I've ever tried. You might request the sauces on the side if that's your preference, as some dishes tend to be heavy. You can't go wrong with their tacos and the beer-battered avocado is a good choice if you're not a fan of fake meats, but don't be scared of the amazing BBQ jackfruit! The crispy chikn sandwich will make you forget about Chick-Fil-A; get buffalo if you like it spicy. If you want to try a special that they post on special media, arrive early. They will sell out and you will be disappointed. It took me two attempts to score a California burrito. It's huge, packed full of asada, pinto beans, Mexican rice, fries, guacamole and more, and definitely worth $12. They even make a huge bacon burger with doughnut buns using Ronald's doughnuts. What the...\n\nI'll be patiently waiting until they return and I can enjoy my next crispy avocado BLT wrap. Come back soon!"

Found this company with great reviews, so I was super excited and anxious to try the food. Woke up early as Yelp showed only opened on weekends and closed at 2pm as they're at a Farmers market. Called the phone number listed and received recording stating the caller is not taking calls at this time (strange), then decided to show up. Drove about 13 miles from my stay and to my disappointment, this restaurant showing it was open was no where to be seen. Asked other venders and they hadn't seen them in a while. No way of contacting them for info, Ad is not accurate and phone number does not work. Unable to rate the food unfortunately. Hopefully some day!"

Their tacos are amazing and they seem to regularly change up their menu, which is nice. I cannot leave their tent without grabbing some of their fresh made Jaimica. \n\nIt is one of those rare vegan places where you are staring at the menu for 15 minutes because you just can't choose. Family run and very friendly. I haven't tried their vegan cheesecakes, but they seem like a crowd favorite. I would 10/10 recommend the Garden Grill to any vegan, or meat eater, that enjoys food!\n\nFour stars due to a website that is not kept updated. There have been multiple times where i have traveled across the valley to find this \"food truck\" in their regular spots, but they are not there. After i find this out and check their website, there is nothing there saying that they cancelled that day. Apparently they keep their Instagram updated very well; however, for those of us who don't use Instagram, it would be nice to see that the website is updated. \n\nGreat place!"

Wow! I was, once again, blown away and my taste buds were thoroughly impressed. \nI was unable to finish the whole thing because it's huge, so I took the rest home and my omni Dad stole and devoured it. Never told him it was vegan, but since he knows I don't eat meat he probably guessed. He wanted to get their location and dates so he could stop by after work and get one for himself. Vegan food is just salads by bottom! \nI don't know what these guys do to make their food so delicious, but they need to keep doing it! I love everything I have tried so far.

Now that I've tried almost the entire menu, I have a hard time deciding what I want to get because it's all so good! If I had to pick a favorite I'd choose the crispy chick'n sandwich, but the beer-battered avocado tacos come in at a close second. Almost every week they have special items too, and I'd advise getting there early because sometimes they can run out pretty quickly! I could go into detail about specific menu items, but I'm not even going to bother because I've discovered that you really can't go wrong no matter what you order here. Everything is seriously amazing.\n\nAs far as price goes, some might say it's a bit pricey, but it's definitely worth the few extra dollars. The food is so flavorful, they use local and organic ingredients when possible, and the people are super friendly. I'm currently transitioning to veganism, and Garden Grill definitely helps satisfy the occasional meat cravings.

So disappointed. \n\nThe tacos were ok, but I would never go out of my way to go to this place again.\n\nWith all the great places to eat on the LV Strip, I'd skip this place and pay more for better quality food and for a place that keeps up with healthy sanitary standards and practices.\n\nThey were not busy at all. I should have known when there wasn't a line out the door for $2 tacos that I should have skipped this place."

This is how small business should be, always looking to improve. I admire that and will definitely return in the near future to give it a try again. \n\nProbably not the best tacos you can get for the price. Maybe I was overhyped from yelp but I was disappointed. Ordered the 3 Tacos Combo with Rice and Beans for about $10. Tortilla had a stale taste, carne asada was dry and flavorless. Didn't care for their rice and beans. Thought it was pretty expensive compared to most authentic Mexican food trucks that tastes wayyy better! It could be a slow night and what we ended up with were cold leftovers. Not sure if I would come back to try it again. :("

One person is preparing our orders while 6 others are standing around, talking, acting like their busy but they're not. They act like they're only assigned to one job (i.e. cashier) so they stick to that one job post even when there's no one to help while one lady is running around putting tortillas on the grill, flipping them, putting the meat and fillings in it and assembling it. When one girl tried to tip her, another worker came up and said that's not allowed. What do you mean it's not allowed? They probably split tip if we had left it in the tip jar.

I came with my best friend who recently moved to Vegas and even she stated, \"I've been on the strip so many times and never seen this taco spot\". Yup!! Thanks to Yelp we were able to ball on a budget here.\n\nWe walked in and notice their menu. They had many different things to order: Taco Platter, Quesadilla, Burrito, Salad or bowl. You can pick your meat and don't worry; they have all type of meat: Steak, Chicken, Pork, Shredded Beef, Grilled Fish, and Crispy Fish. No matter what meat you get EVERYTHING is DE-LISH!\n\nI am in LOVE with Tacos so of course I ordered the Taco Platter plate which consisted of: 3 tacos and 2 sides. I was able to make both my sides rice (Yes, I love rice as well) HAHA! \nWhat I really liked most was that you were able to put your on toppings on your tacos. Normal taco places that I go to in California they just do the norm: Cilantro and salsa but this place has it all baybee! Avocado, sour cream, different type of salsas, tomatoes, lettuce, cilantro...OMG!! REALLY!\n\nMy best friend ordered the bowl and she truly enjoyed it! Matter of fact the bowl could actually feed two people! NOICEEE!\n\nThey also had outdoor seating and indoor seating (Limited seating inside). During the time I came here it was 100 degrees in Vegas so seating inside or outside to me was miserable.\n \nThe inside has NO A/C! OMG how can the workers stand to work in that HOT environment! Anywho, my only concern was the hotness in that joint. They would definitely be 5 stars once they fix that A'C problem.\n\nIn the meantime, 4 stars for the cheap Taco spot on the Vegas Strip!\n\nTill next time DJ's Taco Bar!"

Maybe she didn't understand me, maybe she didn't know. Call me old-fashioned, but I think staff should be polite to customers when they ask a simple question and find out the answers if they don't know. As I was eating, the place started to fill up with smoke. It was coming from the grill where they were cooking the meat. A little smoke, I don't mind. But it was literally filling up the place to the point where it was quite thick. Me and another couple that was there left and ate outside.

On today's visit, the manager, Maria, was helping the line and she was very friendly and nice, which is always a plus. A co-worker was with me and we both ordered our shrimp at the same time because last week they had run out of the prepared shrimp, so we had to wait for it to grill. She said that she was on top of it this week and made sure that each store had enough fish ready at lunch time. And she definitely didn't skimp on the shrimp! The reason for four stars and not five is that I do feel sometimes they do skimp on the shrimp and that $9.50 for a salad that is a tad on the small is a bit steep. But I don't eat here daily.

But how can I not be when the delicious chicken, rice, beans, salsa, cheese, and sour cream are all delightfully wrapped up in an easy to handle and nom on burrito?\n\nZaba's is slightly different from other similar Mexican chains. I do believe they are locally owned (sorry if I'm mistaken in that). They also offer wheat tortillas (for no extra charge). I've never had a problem with service at this location. It's quick, efficient and for the most part the staff is friendly. \n\nStill, my favorite burrito-go-to is Qdoba. However, Zaba's IS good and its location so close to me makes it a favorite spot of mine."

We literally have tried all the tacos they have on their menu. Every single one of them was made with love! \nWe've been here twice and everything tastes fresh and just like the first time we been there. \nNot only is the food amazing but the service is 120%. Manny made us feel very welcomed and went through the menu with us and gave us his recommendations. Honestly, at this point I feel like we just need to try every single thing on their menu and I'm sure we won't be disappointed. \n\nBajamar knows exactly what they're doing!

And to add to the wonderfulness (is that a word?, well it fits) they specialize in seafood.  \n\nThe place is small, but clean, open, and airy. The turnover is quick so there's not a wait even when they're busy. Our server/host/busboy was quick, efficient, friendly, and responsive.\n\nWe had the Bajamar shrimp tacos, the pulpo enchilado, and the Lucas taco. The shrimp taco had perfectly battered talapia, red cabbage, salsa fresca, and a wonderful cream salsa which all combined to make a tortilla envelope of goodness. The pulpo enchilado consists of saut\u00e9ed octopus in a chili de arbol sauce, Monterrey cheese, salsa fresca, and a tasty and smooth chipotle cream sauce. The taco was incredible but the octopus kind of gets lost in everything, so I might have to sample this taco many many times to make up my mind. The Lucas taco is the specialty here and once you sample one you'll see why. Saut\u00e9ed shrimp combined with grilled bell pepper, Monterrey cheese, and chipotle cream sauce make a scrumptious titanic taco. These are not huge tacos, pictures don't do them justice, but they are dense and tightly packed with amazing flavor and are highly satisfying."

We also ordered a few appetizers and were pleasantly surprised.  When the rest of our tacos came we quickly devoured them and they were fresh, crisp and delicious.  We then knew if the rest of the tacos were that good, we should try the octopus.  4 of us ordered the octopus and they were so good.

Beware, this place is hooked onto a gas station. Although, I was not deterred from the location by that, some others may be though. It is also on skeezy Boulder Highway.\n\nTheir menu is huge including things like seafood, al pastor, chimichangas, nachos, carne asada fries, etc etc... you get it. Like most Mexican places around town they offer the full gamut of choices. \n\nI went with the tamale plate... the tamales were dry, meat was okay. Beans and rice were... beans and rice.\n\nFor my husband I ordered the carne asada plate. Your choice of flour or corn tortillas. Comes with a heaping mound of carne asada, guac, salad, rice and beans. Overall I'd say just okay. The amount of food is tremendous. This meal could be shared among three people.\n\nI also went ahead and ordered a plate of nachos. Decided to go with the carne asada. It was a waste. There was so much guac and junk on it I couldn't even SEE any chips when I opened. Trying to get through to actually get a chip was pretty much impossible. I threw it out. Partially because I didn't care for it, partially because the serving was so huge I knew my husband and I would never finish it and it would be very doubtful we would reheat and eat it again.\n\nThere are a lot of Mexican places in Las Vegas....

I've scurried out more than once to avoid being witness to a holdup. (Don't judge). If it wasn't for the bad location, I'd eat there more often. \n\nSo, my advice?  Go during high traffic hours. I've never had trouble during the morning or afternoon commute. The food is really good. Everything is fresh and made to order. They have a couple little tables to wait while they cook. But it's not really a place to eat. It is inside a gas station, after all. \n\n\nThe tacos and burritos are on point. I love the breakfast burritos and honestly, I can never eat the whole thing. The meat is always well seasoned, the veggies are fresh, and the rice is tasty.  \n\nThe prices are standard. I think everyone in town charges almost the same thing.

Everyone was satisfied with the food and portions. Geo brought all the condiments which were fresh and the options were plentiful. There were three different salsa's, all which brought different levels of heat, but delicious. The food was served quickly. Geo was even accommodating to our special request of cheese taco shell (which I highly recommend). Would definitely recommend him to cater your next event!!"
